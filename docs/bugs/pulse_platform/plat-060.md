# PLAT-060 — Ops-owned config decisions did not carry their reason into the config

| Coordination | Value |
|---|---|
| Assigned agent | `Claude Code` |
| Ticket state | `implemented; runtime reverify deferred` |
| Last synchronized | `2026-08-09` |

- **Priority:** P2
- **Owner:** `update_step_config` write path · `llm_ops_review` → Fixer handoff
- **Related:** PLAT-059 (`lock_learnings_reason`) established the pattern.

## Problem

`llm_ops_review` already owns tier, model and execution-mode selection, is
explicitly read-only, and already produces *"current state, exact suggestion,
expected benefit, risk, and evidence"* for every recommendation — including a
strict tier-downgrade policy ending *"missing evidence means keep the tier."*

That rationale never reached the config:

1. Ops writes the evidence into the Pulse finding.
2. The Fixer applies it with `update_step_config(execution_tier=…)` — **no
   reason parameter**.
3. `planning/step_config.json`, which is what the *next* reviewer reads, records
   the change with no trace of why.
4. The Fixer had **no guidance at all** for this class of change: `execution_tier`,
   `declared_execution_mode`, and `tier` returned nothing from
   `pulse-review-fixer.md` or `pulse-fixer-practices.md`.

Two consequences were invisible at the call site:

- Setting `execution_tier` **permanently disables adaptive tiering** for the step
  (`shouldUseAdaptiveExecutionTiering`), so it stops promoting high→medium after
  3 stable runs.
- `execution_llm` **outranks tier entirely** and does not follow provider-profile
  updates.

## Implementation (2026-08-09)

Three validators alongside `validateLockLearningsChange`
(`controller_learning_helpers.go`), called from the `update_step_config` handler:

| Field | Reason | Consequence named in the rejection |
|---|---|---|
| `execution_tier` | `execution_tier_reason` (new) | disables adaptive tiering |
| `execution_llm` | `execution_llm_reason` (new) | outranks tier; ignores profile updates |
| `declared_execution_mode` | `declared_execution_mode_reason` (existed, now required) | scripted freezes behaviour into `main.py` |

- Reasons are read **before** their fields in the handler, so a reason supplied
  in the same call satisfies its own validator.
- Clearing a field clears its reason; clearing never requires one.
- Guidance: `ops-review.md` (write recommendations so they can be stored
  verbatim as the reason), `pulse-fixer-practices.md` (net-new "Applying an Ops
  config recommendation" playbook), `step-config.md`.
- UI: the `execution_tier` dropdown in `StepEditPanel.tsx` was removed, as the
  `lock_learnings` toggle was in PLAT-059. Current tier stays visible.

### The escape hatch is load-bearing

A required field invites a confabulated answer from an agent that has already
decided to act, and **an invented justification is harder to challenge later
than a missing one**. Every rejection therefore names the sanctioned
alternative: raise a decision with `create_human_input_request` and park the
finding `awaiting_user`. That path is already enforced —
`RecordPulseFindingDispositionsTx` rejects `awaiting_user` when the decision does
not exist or is no longer pending. Uncertainty is a legitimate terminal state.

### What was deliberately NOT gated

`learning_objective` and `knowledgebase_contribution` take **no** reason field.
They are meant to be refined continuously as evidence accumulates, and a
write-time gate would suppress exactly that iteration. Instead the Fixer's skill
playbook gained a yield check (step 5b) reading the already-recorded
`detection_history[].has_new_learning` in `.learning_metadata.json`: repeated
no-yield means sharpen the objective or drop to `learnings_access="read"`.
Reflection turns measured **20.1% of all LLM time** on Social Media's run, so an
objective that never yields is pure overhead — `ops-review.md` now names that a
first-class cost line.

## Regression tests

`ops_config_reason_test.go` — five tests: each field rejected without a reason,
accepted with one, not gated when unset; clearing clears the reason; reasons
survive `MergeAgentConfigFields`. Each rejection is asserted to name its hidden
consequence **and** `create_human_input_request`.

Full run reproduced the known 22-failure baseline exactly; no new failures.

## Acceptance / reverify

**Runtime reverify is deferred and cannot be claimed yet**: `llm_ops_review` is
currently disabled at the Gate for the core-system verification phase, so the
lens that supplies these reasons does not run. The enforcement is live; the
loop it serves resumes when that block is removed from `pulse-gate.md`.
