# PLAT-141 — tool results that arrive in 41ms never become tool_call_end events, so the UI shows a completed command as unresolved

| Coordination | Value |
|---|---|
| Assigned agent | unassigned |
| Ticket state | `implemented` — pairing hypothesis disproven, transcript recovery shipped (`multi-llm-provider-go@291b2ea`, `633c97d19`); live reverify pending |
| Last synchronized | `2026-08-18` |

- **Priority:** P2 — display only. No work is lost and no decision is made on
  missing data, but the chat misreports completed commands, and the compensating
  code added on 2026-08-18 fabricates durations while doing so.
- **Owner:** whatever converts a coding-agent turn's tool activity into
  `tool_call_start` / `tool_call_end` store events, plus
  `internal/events/event_store.go` (the settle that currently papers over it).

## Measured

`tectonicusadaytrading`, 2026-08-18, tool call `toolu_01GTECvgs77yocXxYx1nbfpb`:

| source | fact |
|---|---|
| Claude Code transcript `598f5b59` | `tool_use` at `15:52:26.430Z`, `tool_result` at `15:52:26.471Z`, 71-char result |
| our event store | `START` logged `21:22:26` (= `15:52:26Z`); **no `END` ever logged, under any session** |
| our UI | chip settled at `21:23:23`, displayed duration **45.4s** |

**The command completed in 41 milliseconds.** The result has been in the
transcript ever since. Our store never produced an end event for it, and the
duration shown to the user is start-to-settle, not the tool's real duration.

Earlier in the same session, 117 tool calls started and 103 ended — the ones
that fail to pair are a minority and are not distinguished by tool name
(`execute_shell_command` appears on both sides of the split).

## What is proven

1. The tool ran and returned promptly; nothing failed, nothing was lost.
2. No `tool_call_end` event entered the store for these calls. This is not
   lateness — a longer wait cannot recover an event that is never produced.
3. The 5-second grace window added on 2026-08-18 (`3c527c9d4`) does not address
   this population. It was sized on a genuinely-late case measured on a
   different session (turn end `20:34:28`, tool end `20:34:29`) and helps there.
4. The settle's displayed duration is fabricated relative to the tool's real
   duration (45.4s shown, 41ms actual).

## Hypothesis resolved (2026-08-19)

The pairing theory below is **wrong**. The store's telemetry logs every
`ToolCallEndEvent` added under any session, and `END id=toolu_01GTECvg…` returns
zero lines. The end is not mis-routed to a sub-session; it is **never emitted at
all**. The sub-session identifiers are real but incidental.

## Fix shipped

`claudecode.ToolResultsFromTranscript` reads completed calls out of the CLI's own
transcript, keyed by tool-call id, returning the real output and the real
runtime. The settle asks for them before closing a chip, so a 41ms command now
reads as 41ms and shows what it printed.

The event store does not know any of this. It calls a resolver that `cmd/server`
installs — a package that models events should not know which CLI wrote them —
so the native session id, working directory and transcript shape stay on the
server side, where the live handle already is.

Every path that cannot answer returns not-found rather than a guess: a session
already torn down, a non-Claude provider, an empty result, a missing or
unreadable transcript. The chip then closes blank, as it did before.

### Still to do

- **Live reverify**: confirm recovered chips show real output and real durations.
- **Delete the compensating code** once verified. The 5s grace window helps a
  genuinely-late population measured on a different session and can stay for
  now, but the blank settle exists only for this gap.
- A session torn down before the settle cannot be recovered — the native id
  lives on the live handle. If that proves common, the id needs persisting.

## What was NOT proven (superseded by the resolution above)

The tools are dispatched under **sub-session identifiers** while the store
tracks open calls under the parent schedule session. Three appear in the same
minute:

    session_id=msgseq-iteration-0-default-step-1-place-paper-trades
    session_id=schedule-manual--cd0655e9_1787068265820483000
    session_id=sub-exec-eval-signal-freshness-1787068341244552000

A plausible reading is that the start is attributed to the schedule session and
the completion is produced under the step's own session, so the two never pair.
**This has not been demonstrated** — no `END` was found under any session id for
the affected call, which is equally consistent with the end never being emitted
at all. Both readings must be tested before a fix is chosen; picking one on
plausibility is how the wrong cause got shipped twice already today.

## Candidate fixes

1. **Attribute both events to the same session.** Correct at source if the
   pairing hypothesis holds. Touches session routing that other work is
   currently editing.
2. **Backfill from the transcript.** The result and its true duration are on
   disk. `readClaudeTranscriptMessages` already parses this shape in
   `multi-llm-provider-go`'s `claudecode` package, but is unexported. This fixes
   the display regardless of which reading above is right, and repairs the
   fabricated durations.

Option 2 also lets the grace window and the settle placeholder be **deleted**
rather than kept — both exist only to make this gap survivable.

## Acceptance

- A `message_sequence` step's tool calls pair start-to-end in the store.
- A settled chip, if any remain, shows the tool's real duration.
- The grace window and `(output not captured)` placeholder are removed once the
  underlying events are complete.
