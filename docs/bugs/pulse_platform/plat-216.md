## Internal tracking resolution — 2026-09-05

Related follow-up resolved: RTS PUL-4FE07CD2. Nonzero saved-script exits can no longer be promoted to success by passing artifact validation. Exit-2 refusal and repair fallback remain unchanged. Focused scripted tests pass; this was separate from the original PLAT-216 fix.

Closed at the user's request for internal tracking. Fixes are tested local,
uncommitted source changes based on `0babf193ec0efdf33511a3150f82e0b29685814e`;
deployment verification is pending. No live workflow or historical schedule
receipt was modified. Prior investigation below is retained as history.

# PLAT-216 — a scripted step's deliberate fail-closed refusal was treated identically to a crash, so the agentic fallback overrode the refusal it agreed was correct

- **Priority:** P1 — real financial-data-integrity incident. A fail-closed
  guard written specifically to prevent overwriting bank balance history
  with unverifiable data was read, agreed with, and then overridden by the
  runtime's own fallback mechanism on the same run.
- **Owner:** `agent_go/pkg/orchestrator/agents/workflow/step_based_workflow/controller_scripted.go`
  (`decideScriptedFastPath`, `tryRunSavedScriptedScript`),
  `controller_execution.go` (the scripted-step relearn dispatch),
  `cmd/server/guidance/templates/system/code-authoring.md`.
- **Related:** `harness:scripted-step-fallback:protective-abort-overridden-by-agentic-retry`
  (`Workflow/HDFC-Personal-Accounts`, high) — the finding this fixes.

## The finding

`update-bank-balance`'s `main.py` implements a BR5-01 fail-closed guard: if
it cannot verify the existing "Bank Balance" rows before writing, it
`sys.exit(1)`s with an explicit refusal (`'ABORT: failed to read existing
"Bank Balance" rows ...; refusing to overwrite and risk wiping history'`)
rather than risk corrupting real balance data. On 2026-08-05, the guard
fired correctly — and the runtime's own agentic fallback then read that
exact refusal, its own completion summary stating *"the script correctly
fail-closed... I replicated its exact logic interactively... wrote all 21
rows... Also upserted the balance_history row in db.sqlite via the safe
copy-swap pattern."* The fallback agreed the refusal was correct and did
the refused write anyway.

## Root cause — confirmed live in code, not inferred

`decideScriptedFastPath`'s own doc comment states the design directly:
*"the fallback is the feature: when a scripted step's main.py fails, the
run must NOT fail — it must fall back to the LLM carrying the broken
script and its error so the model can fix it."* That is correct for a
genuine bug. The code made **no distinction** between "the script crashed"
and "the script deliberately exited nonzero because it detected an unsafe
condition and correctly refused" — both produced the identical
`PriorScript`/`PriorError` relearn path, handing the LLM the refusal as
"something to fix" rather than "evidence you should not proceed."

## Fix

Presented the user two shapes for a deliberate-refusal signal (a reserved
exit code vs. a structured stdout marker) plus the option to defer given
the safety stakes; the user chose the reserved exit code, given past
guidance that text-sniffing heuristics carry real false-positive/negative
risk.

Added `ScriptedTerminalRefusalExitCode = 2`: a script opts into "this
refusal is terminal, do not fall back to an agentic retry" by exiting
exactly this code, distinct from the still-conventional `sys.exit(1)` (or
any other nonzero code), which keeps today's relearn-fallback behavior
completely unchanged. Detected in `tryRunSavedScriptedScript` before
pre-validation runs (mirroring the existing `ErrScriptedHarnessRejection`
early-return, since a deliberate refusal has nothing valid to validate),
producing a new `TerminalRefusal`/`TerminalRefusalReason` result. Wired
through `decideScriptedFastPath` and `controller_execution.go`'s scripted
dispatch to abort the step outright — the same shape as the existing
harness-rejection abort — with an error that states plainly this is the
script working correctly, not a bug, and instructs against modifying
`main.py` or attempting the refused write.

Updated `code-authoring.md` (the guidance script authors read) with a new
"Deliberate refusal" section documenting the convention and naming the
live incident as the reason it matters.

## Explicitly not done

- Did not edit HDFC's own `learnings/update-bank-balance/main.py` to switch
  its BR5-01 guard from `sys.exit(1)` to `sys.exit(2)` — per this session's
  standing rule, a workflow's own script files are that workflow's
  automation's domain, not something to edit from the platform side. The
  new mechanism is available for that workflow (or its own Fixer/builder
  pass) to adopt.
- Did not attempt to retroactively classify past `sys.exit(1)` refusals as
  terminal — this is opt-in by construction: only a script that is updated
  to use the reserved code gets the new behavior, so no existing script's
  behavior changes silently.
- Did not build a structured stdout-marker alternative — the user chose the
  exit-code approach specifically to avoid the false-positive/negative risk
  of text parsing for a safety-critical signal.

## Verification

- `go build ./...` clean.
- New tests: `TestTerminalRefusalAbortsInsteadOfRelearning` (the decision
  layer correctly surfaces `TerminalRefusal` and withholds relearn
  context), `TestOrdinaryNonZeroExitStillRelearnsNotJustReservedCode`
  (exit code 1 is unaffected — this is opt-in, not a reinterpretation of
  all failures), `TestTerminalRefusalStepErrorExplainsItIsNotABug` (source
  check: the abort happens before relearn context is assigned, and the
  error text says "not a bug"/"working correctly"), and
  `TestTerminalRefusalResultCarriesNoRunEvidence` (source check: the
  branch does not run pre-validation or count against
  `lock_code_stats`/`consecutive_failures`, mirroring the existing
  harness-rejection precedent).
- All 4 new tests plus the existing `TestScriptedFastPathDecision`,
  `TestHarnessRejectionAbortsInsteadOfRelearning`,
  `TestGenuineScriptFailureStillRelearns`, and the other pre-existing
  scripted-fallback tests pass unchanged.
- Full suite: 3 pre-existing failures before and after this change
  (`cmd/server/guidance`, unrelated content), no regression.
- Not yet reverified live — HDFC's own script must adopt `sys.exit(2)` for
  BR5-01 (or any equivalent guard) before this specific incident's
  recurrence can be directly confirmed fixed; the mechanism itself is
  proven by the new tests.
