| Ticket state | `reopened` — the 2026-08-10 fix was **silently deleted by a refactor on 2026-08-13** and the bug recurred on 2026-08-16; restored 2026-08-17, see "Regression" below |

- **Priority:** P1 — Pulse's durable history understates successful runs, and terminal command states are immutable
- **Owner:** scheduler workshop turn loop (`scheduler.go`)
- **Found on:** social-media, 2026-08-10, session `schedule-cron--5227790a_1786354253197815000`
- **Reported by:** the workflow's own Pulse finalizer, which escalated rather than acting — correctly, since this is scheduler behaviour outside its authority

## Regression: the fix was deleted three days after it shipped

The 2026-08-10 fix lived in the `waitForWorkshopIdle` failure branch, and
PLAT-084 extended it there on 2026-08-11. On 2026-08-13, `d18e071e1` ("Unify
scheduled turn lifecycle and runtime tab routing") replaced that waiter with
`waitForConversationTurnTree` and removed the whole branch — taking both fixes
with it. `workshopRunStartedDuringInvocation` was left in the file with **zero
callers**, and `ProducedRunEvidence` went back to being computed only on the
success path, exactly as before this ticket existed.

social-media then lost a second run to the identical bug on 2026-08-16: a post
landed and was independently verified, the turn failed on an idle-wait timeout
(see [PLAT-117](plat-117.md) for why it timed out at all), and the operator was
emailed "Workflow did not start. No results were produced."

**Nothing caught the deletion, and that is the more important finding.** Both
tests this ticket shipped still pass today, because they call
`workshopRunStartedDuringInvocation` directly with hand-built folder lists and
never drive `executeWorkshopJob`. Delete the only caller and they stay green.
Go does not help either: an unused *function* compiles cleanly, unlike an unused
variable or import. This is precisely the invariant PLAT-105 already wrote down
— *a test must reach the state under test through the product path, never by
constructing it* — written down before this happened, and it happened anyway.

**Restored 2026-08-17** as `preserveRunEvidenceAfterFailedTurn`, called from the
generic turn-failure return in `executeWorkshopJob`. That placement is
deliberately wider than the original: "did a run actually start?" is answered by
the run's own metadata regardless of *how* the session died, and widening is
safe because `workshopRunStartedDuringInvocation` requires a real timestamp at
or after the invocation began and treats an unreadable record as nothing, so no
failure mode can manufacture evidence.

## What happened

```
09:30:53Z  scheduler starts the session
09:34:45Z  workflow run starts        (runs/iteration-0/default)
12:15:18Z  workflow run COMPLETES     run_metadata.json status: "completed"
12:49:35Z  scheduler declares "workshop idle wait timed out ... (live_child_work=false)"
```

The run **succeeded**: 19 actions landed (1 post, 8 replies, 6 likes, 4 follows), 18/19 independently verified, evaluation scored 17/40, 238 artifact files written. The scheduler recorded the whole invocation as an error **34 minutes after the work had finished**, and Pulse was then told the workflow had not run at all — so `publish` was `skipped: no Pulse Gate/reviewer/Fixer...` and `notify` stalled at `waiting`.

The workflow's own backup record states it plainly:

> the Pulse Finalizer for this run_id was invoked with the premise 'workflow did not run', which is factually incorrect — the execution route completed in this session... The scheduler's 10m idle-wait watchdog fired because the builder turn was waiting on step notifications, not because the workflow failed to start.

## Root cause of the record corruption

`ProducedRunEvidence` is initialized `false` (`scheduler.go:2796`) and only computed near the end of the turn loop (`:2939`). The idle-wait failure returns at `:2875`, **before** that computation. So the flag keeps its initialized value and `reviewEvidenceAvailable` (`:2270`) reads false — not because anything examined the run, but because the wait expired.

The durable record said `completed` the entire time. Nothing consulted it.

## The watchdog itself was not wrong

The reporting agent framed this as *"the watchdog is misdiagnosing healthy runs as non-starts."* The harm is real and its evidence is sound, but the mechanism is different and worth stating precisely, because it changes the fix.

`live_child_work=false` was **accurate**. The workflow finished at 12:15:18; by the time the wait expired there genuinely was no live child. PLAT-054's liveness predicate did its job. Raising the timeout would not help either — the session sat idle for 34 minutes after completing, so a longer window only delays the same wrong conclusion while making genuine stalls slower to detect.

Two distinct defects are involved:

1. **The parent turn never resumed after the workflow completed.** Its own note says it *"was waiting on step notifications"*. This is PLAT-067's family — a child finishes, the parent never advances — and remains **open**.
2. **A timeout is allowed to overwrite a durable success record.** Independent of (1), and the more damaging of the two, because Pulse's finalized command states are immutable: a false "did not run" is permanent. Fixed here.

## Fix shipped (defect 2)

The idle-wait failure path now consults the durable record before returning, and preserves run evidence when a run actually started during this invocation. The run still fails — the session genuinely stalled, and that should stay visible — but Pulse is no longer told the workflow never ran.

It uses a new baseline-free helper, `workshopRunStartedDuringInvocation`, rather than the existing `workshopRunProducedEvidence`. That distinction matters: the existing helper asks "is this folder new?" first, which is right when it holds a real baseline but inverts when it does not — an empty baseline from a failed listing (PLAT-070, same day) makes the first folder look new and returns true unconditionally. On this path the narrower question — *did a run actually start?* — has a trustworthy answer needing no baseline. A record with no usable timestamp counts as nothing, so an unreadable record can never manufacture evidence.

Tests pin both directions: a pre-existing `iteration-0` reused by this invocation counts as evidence with no baseline at all, and older or unstamped runs never do.

## Fix shipped (defect 1)

Traced from the log. The turn did not hang — it **finished**, and the watchdog could not tell:

```
18:08:36  eval completion steered into the session
18:09:30  [BG AGENT] Synthetic turn completed (211 messages)
18:09:30  [ACTIVE_SESSION] status -> completed
          ...ten minutes of nothing at all...
18:19:35  idle wait expired (live_child_work=false)
```

A genuinely idle session is detected in about six seconds (two consecutive not-busy polls). Timing out instead means `sessionIsBusy` kept returning **true** for ten minutes after the turn's own completion was recorded.

There are two independent notions of busy and they disagreed. `sessionIsBusy` reads the runtime snapshot `Phase`; `isSessionBusy` is the explicit per-turn flag set at turn start and cleared at turn end. The snapshot phase stayed busy while the session's own lifecycle status said `completed`.

**This is the same signature as PLAT-065** — there too, `sessionIsBusy` stayed true after the Gate turn's tool call had durably succeeded, causing `abortIfTurnStillBusy` to kill the remaining Pulse stages. Both are very likely one underlying defect: the runtime snapshot phase not returning to a non-busy state when a turn ends.

The fix does not touch that state machine. At the point where the loop is already about to declare a timeout — nothing running, nothing progressed for the whole inactivity window — it now also consults the explicit per-turn flag. If that flag is clear, the only signal still claiming work is the snapshot phase, contradicted by everything else, and the turn is treated as finished. A genuine stall keeps its flag set and still times out. A diagnostic line records both signals when it does, so the next real stall is fully explained.

## Still open

- **The underlying phase staleness**: why the runtime snapshot `Phase` fails to leave busy when a turn completes. This fix reconciles the symptom at one call site; PLAT-065's `abortIfTurnStillBusy` reads the same stale signal and is not covered by it.
- **Historical records stay wrong.** Terminal Pulse command states are immutable by design, so the two runs already recorded as non-runs cannot be corrected. This ticket stops new ones; it does not repair the history. The reporting agent noted an identical earlier occurrence, making this at least the second.
- **Recurrence count.** The reporting agent called this "the eighth idle-timeout in this series". Not independently verified here — the log was truncated by the 12:26 restart — but the two corroborated occurrences are enough to treat it as recurring rather than incidental.

## 2026-08-20 recurrence: successful reused nested run was outside the dashboard cap

LinkedIn Engage completed normally in `runs/iteration-0/engage`: its durable
metadata records `started_at=2026-08-20T13:10:18Z`,
`completed_at=2026-08-20T13:36:34Z`, and `status=completed`. The scheduler still
set `ProducedRunEvidence=false` and sent the no-run Finalizer, which emailed the
operator that the workflow did not start.

This was the success-path counterpart of the same broken invariant. The primary
detector reused the dashboard-oriented run-folder loader. That loader sorts by
iteration number and truncates to ten folders *before* loading metadata. Because
LinkedIn already had iterations 16 through 25, the newly restarted
`iteration-0/engage` folder was absent from the returned list and its current
timestamp could never be examined. The existing fallback recognized only
`execute_step` workflow-step receipts; it ignored the session-linked `full_run`
receipt that `run_full_workflow` had already emitted for this exact invocation.

**Fix:** scheduler evidence now treats both declared `full_run` receipts and
declared `workflow_step` receipts created under the exact schedule session after
the invocation boundary as authoritative evidence. Generic background agents and
receipts older than the invocation remain excluded. The capped folder listing is
only a secondary compatibility signal, so UI pagination can no longer decide
whether Pulse believes a workflow ran.

Focused regression coverage proves a completed session-linked `full_run` counts,
the existing direct workflow-step case still counts, unrelated background work
does not count, and an older full-run receipt cannot manufacture evidence for a
new invocation.

## Reopened: watchdog stamps failed finalizer commands before the Finalizer runs (2026-08-11)

Instagram's successful scheduled run is a separate reproduction of the same
harm: permanent Pulse status now says work failed even though the work was
done. The producing workflow delivered a reel and email successfully, and the
subsequent Finalizer actually ran backup and notification. Yet before that
Finalizer turn recorded any result, `pulse_final_command_state` already
contained these immutable rows for
`schedule-manual--bae435e5_1786432476119732000`:

```text
backup, publish, notify -> failed
started_at == finished_at == 2026-08-11T09:48:06Z
reason = "Finalizer ended without recording this command's outcome"
```

The identical timestamps and wording prove these were watchdog-generated
placeholders, not three real command attempts. The Finalizer began later, so
it had no truthful way to replace the terminal rows. This is not fixed by the
earlier "durable run evidence" reconciliation: that preserves evidence that a
workflow ran; it does not stop the scheduler from finalizing command status
before the relevant command stage starts.

### Required follow-up

The scheduler must not write an immutable `failed` result merely because a
Finalizer has not started or has not yet recorded a command. Keep commands
`waiting`/`running` until the finalizer's terminal lifecycle is known, or use
a reversible watchdog placeholder which the Finalizer can replace. Only a
known failed/aborted Finalizer may finalize still-unrecorded commands as
failed. Add an integration test where a delayed but successful Finalizer
records backup/notify after the watchdog observes an inter-stage gap.

## Acceptance

- A run that completes and then stalls is still reported as an error, but Pulse receives run evidence and reviews it instead of skipping on "did not run".
- Evidence is never manufactured when the run record is missing or unstamped.
- Defect 1 tracked separately; closing this ticket does not close the stall.
