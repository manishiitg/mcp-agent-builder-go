# PLAT-139 — a workflow step held its caller for 65 minutes after its real work finished; root cause confirmed via a second live occurrence

| Coordination | Value |
|---|---|
| Assigned agent | unassigned |
| Ticket state | `fixed` — root cause confirmed live via a production goroutine dump on a second occurrence (`check-form-26as-xspaces`, same day), fixed in `multi-llm-provider-go@6d8e4e9`. Fail-before/pass-after verified against a hermetic reproduction whose failing stack trace matches the production dump exactly, not a guess |

- **Priority:** P1 — a genuinely successful run reports as stuck/never-completing
  and holds its caller indefinitely. Unattended paths (Pulse, schedules,
  workflow steps) have nobody watching to notice, and the run's own
  `run_metadata.json` can be left frozen at `"status": "running"`.
- **Owner:** unassigned — the layer is not yet identified. Candidate layers in
  "Where to look next" below.
- **Related:** [PLAT-116](plat-116.md) (same *shape* of symptom on the tmux
  path; its Pi structured section documents this incident's disproven first
  diagnosis in full)

## The incident

2026-08-18, workflow `ICICI-BANK-PARSING-v2`, group `manishiitg`, step
`statement-download`, execution `workflow-full-msy44vw303`.

- The step's **real work completed at 09:45** — statements downloaded,
  `logout_verified: true` recorded in its own output.
- The caller was then **held for ~65 minutes**, until the stack was stopped by
  hand. The scheduler sat polling
  `query_step(execution_id: workflow-full-msy44vw303)` for a completion that
  never arrived.
- Because the manual shutdown killed the workspace server before the
  orchestrator flushed terminal status, that write was swallowed and
  `run_metadata.json` is **still frozen at `"status": "running"`** — the run
  reads as live rather than failed. (That swallowed-terminal-write behaviour is
  its own defect, noted in PLAT-116 and not owned here.)

## What this is NOT — ruled out, with evidence

Recording these so the same ground is not re-tread. Each was believed and, in
two cases, shipped against.

### 1. NOT "pi never emits `agent_settled`"

The original diagnosis was that pi 0.84.2 stopped emitting `agent_settled`, so
the structured adapter's only teardown trigger was dead code. The supporting
measurement — *"0 occurrences of `agent_settled` against 57 `agent_end` across a
day of production logs"* — was a **logging artifact created by the measurement
itself**: the adapter *handled* `agent_settled` in a `case` arm that logs
nothing, while `agent_end` fell through to the `default:` arm whose only job is
`Debugf("pi: unhandled event type=%q")`. The grep compared a deliberately-silent
handled event against a deliberately-logged unhandled one.

Refuted by running the real CLI with a real key, a real stdio MCP server via
`.pi/mcp.json`, and the adapter's exact flags
(`--print --mode json --no-builtin-tools -e npm:pi-mcp-adapter --approve`):

```
   1 "type":"agent_end"
   1 "type":"agent_settled"     <-- emitted, and last
>>> pi EXITED on its own after ~5s      (no stale pi or MCP processes)
```

Re-verified twice more (2 consecutive runs, clean exit in 4s each, zero
leftover `pi` or MCP server processes).

`agent_settled` is also correct *by construction* in pi's source
(`dist/core/agent-session.js`): emitted from a `finally` block — unskippable on
success, error, or abort — exactly once per run, **after** the
`while (_handlePostAgentRun())` loop that drives multi-step tool use and
retries has drained. `agent_end` fires *inside* that loop, many times per run.

### 2. NOT fixable by treating `agent_end` as terminal

`multi-llm-provider-go@6609765` did this. It killed a healthy, still-working pi
process within hours — the 3s natural-exit grace expired mid-run:

```
11:56:27 [SHUTDOWN] natural-exit grace (3s) expired for pid 67763
11:56:27 [SHUTDOWN] SIGTERM attempt 1/3 to pgrp 67763
11:56:27 [SHUTDOWN] process 67763 exited after SIGTERM #1
```

surfacing as `pi run failed: exit status 143` (pi's print-mode SIGTERM handler
is `process.exit(143)`). Reverted in `@fd00585`.

### 3. NOT a child process inheriting and holding pi's stdout

A follow-up theory held that pi exits while a spawned child (the MCP bridge)
keeps stdout's write end open, so `<-scannerDone` never unblocks. A four-adapter
rework was built on this and **abandoned before commit**. The MCP SDK spawns
stdio servers with `stdio: ['pipe','pipe', stderr]` — the child gets its **own**
pipes and never inherits the parent's stdout. pi's own adapter additionally
passes `stderr: "ignore"` outside debug mode.

### 4. NOT a missing P0 certification

Also claimed and disproven. `RequiredP0CodingAgentCertificationIDs` early-returns
`nil` for `Transport != tmux`, which looked like "structured transport has zero
P0 coverage" — but **no provider is registered as `Transport: structured`**.
That field is the provider's *primary* transport; all four run tmux primary and
structured secondary, and structured behaviour is certified via capability flags
(`UsesPersistentSession`, `SupportsStructuredStreaming`). Verified by executing
the function:

```
provider=claude-code  transport=tmux  requiredP0=17  [structured_streaming structured_multi_turn]
provider=codex-cli    transport=tmux  requiredP0=17  [structured_streaming structured_multi_turn]
provider=cursor-cli   transport=tmux  requiredP0=16  [structured_streaming structured_multi_turn]
provider=pi-cli       transport=tmux  requiredP0=16  [structured_streaming structured_multi_turn]
```

Structured *completion* is covered specifically: each provider's
`CertStructuredMultiTurn` is a real, live-gated E2E (e.g.
`TestPiCLIStructuredTwoTurnResume`). A two-turn resume cannot pass unless turn
one completed and its process exited — so a genuine structured hang would fail
it. All four P0 enforcement tests pass.

## Root cause, confirmed live (2026-08-18, same day)

A second occurrence — `check-form-26as-xspaces`, `tax-retrieval-sequence` step,
session `c2cf7954-e686-4a18-818b-3730c56884cf` — reproduced the same shape
while the server was still running: real work had completed (form 26AS PDFs,
`tax_summary.json`, `downloads.json` all written 19:06–19:11 IST), the
session's own completion signal fired correctly at 19:43:26
(`[RETAINED_TURN] Settled retained main-agent turn from structured
unified_completion event ... state=completed`), and nothing progressed for
the next ~13 minutes with no live `pi` process anywhere on the machine.

Rather than theorize again, a **production goroutine dump** was pulled via
the already-registered pprof endpoint
(`GET /debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2` — safe, read-only, does not touch the
running workflow) and found the exact blocked goroutine:

```
goroutine 73561 [syscall, 51 minutes]:
  ...
  os/exec.(*Cmd).Wait(...)
  picli.(*PiCLIAdapter).generateContentStructured(...)
      picli_structured_adapter.go:406   <- cmd.Wait() itself, NOT the earlier stdout wait
```

A second goroutine, blocked in the **identical `IO wait` shape for the
identical 51 minutes**, was `os/exec`'s own internal stderr-copy goroutine
(`writerDescriptor.func1`, an `io.Copy` off a pipe the adapter never had a
handle to). The code did:

```go
var stderr bytes.Buffer
cmd.Stderr = &stderr
```

That form makes `os/exec` create and own an **internal** pipe; `cmd.Wait()`
blocks until that pipe's copy goroutine also reaches EOF, not just until the
process is reaped. This morning's entire investigation (see PLAT-116's
"structured completion" section) only ever considered **stdout**, via
`cmd.StdoutPipe()` — stderr, going through the assign-a-`Buffer` form, carried
the exact same class of risk the whole time and was never examined, because it
never went through code anyone had reasoned about.

pi's own process was confirmed gone (no PID via `ps`, no zombie/`<defunct>`
entry) — so this was never "pi is stuck." It was `cmd.Wait()` unable to
determine that, because it was waiting on an internal pipe that nothing had a
handle to close.

**Fixed** in `multi-llm-provider-go@6d8e4e9`: switched to `cmd.StderrPipe()`,
symmetric to stdout — the adapter now owns the pipe, and `os/exec` auto-closes
it the moment the tracked process itself exits, regardless of what else may
still hold the write end. `cmd.Wait()` deliberately still has no hard
timeout — this workflow's tools are allowed up to 90 minutes
(`TOOL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT`), so an aggressive kill risks ending legitimate
work, and there is no way to tell "stuck" from "genuinely still working"
without a bounded backstop that risks exactly that. What changed instead: an
abnormal wait now logs a clear, periodic `ERROR`-level line every 30s pointing
directly at this incident, so a recurrence is visible in `server_debug.log`
without needing another pprof dump.

**Verified, not guessed.** A new hermetic test
(`TestPiStructuredTerminatesWhenChildHoldsStderrAfterProcessExits`,
`picli_structured_process_exit_test.go`) reproduces the mechanism exactly: a
fake `pi` whose own process exits cleanly (stdout drains normally, matching
what "stdout already closed" looked like in production) while a lingering
child holds stderr's write end open. Run against the pre-fix, actually-deployed
code (`fd00585`), it **times out with the identical stack trace** as the
production incident (`os/exec.(*Cmd).Wait → ...writerDescriptor.func1 →
io.Copy → IO wait`) — a reproduction, not a hypothesis. Passes after the fix.

This also explains the original 09:45 ICICI-BANK-PARSING incident that opened
this ticket: same adapter, same `cmd.Stderr = &bytes.Buffer{}` code, same
class of hang. The original incident's logs had already rolled over, so its
exact trigger (what held stderr open that time) is not separately provable —
but the mechanism now proven live is sufficient to close this ticket rather
than leave it as an open mystery.

## What is still true and unexplained

Not fully closed: **what actually holds stderr's write end open** in the first
place has not been identified for either occurrence (unlike the earlier,
disproven MCP-child-inherits-stdout theory, which was checked directly against
the MCP SDK source and ruled out). Candidates not yet investigated: a
descendant of a bash-tool-spawned command inheriting fd 2 in some path not yet
audited, or pi's own runtime under specific conditions. Worth a fresh
investigation if it recurs, now that the adapter itself won't hang regardless
of the answer.

## Superseded — original "where to look next" (kept for the record)

Untested hypotheses, roughly in order of fit:

1. **A tool call that never returned.** The strongest remaining candidate. pi
   emits no events between `tool_execution_start` and `tool_execution_end`, so a
   hung MCP tool (this step is browser/banking automation) looks identical to a
   silent-but-healthy long call. This workflow runs `TOOL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT=90m`,
   so a hang inside that window is bounded only by the tool itself. Check whether
   the last event before the silence was a `tool_execution_start` with no
   matching `_end`.
2. **The layer above the adapter**, i.e. the same `for chunk := range textChan`
   bridge PLAT-116 traces for the tmux path — it is provider- and
   transport-agnostic and has no timeout of its own.
3. **The orchestrator/scheduler poll loop** — whether `query_step` can keep
   reporting in-progress for an execution whose underlying turn has already
   returned.

## Evidence needed (was not captured this time)

The 09:45 window is **no longer in `server_debug.log`** — it had rolled over by
the time the disproven diagnosis was unwound, which is part of why this stayed
unresolved. For the next occurrence, capture before restarting anything:

- the raw pi JSON event stream for the step (specifically: last event before the
  silence, and whether a `tool_execution_start` is unmatched);
- `ps` for the `pi` process **and** its children at the moment of the stall
  (note `pi` is a `#!/usr/bin/env node` script, so match on the full command
  line, not the process name);
- whether the platform's own completion logging
  (`[STREAMING_LIFECYCLE] StreamWithEvents completed`, `[COMPLETION] Updating
  session ... completed`) ever fires;
- goroutine dump of the server, to see which layer is actually parked.

## Acceptance

- [x] The stall is explained by evidence from a real occurrence, not by
  theory — a production goroutine dump, and a hermetic test whose
  pre-fix failure produces the identical stack trace.
- [x] The layer responsible (`cmd.Wait()` blocked on an internally-owned
  stderr pipe) either completes or logs clearly instead of holding its
  caller indefinitely and silently — `cmd.StderrPipe()` fix plus periodic
  stall logging, `multi-llm-provider-go@6d8e4e9`.
- [ ] A run whose work genuinely finished never reports as permanently
  `running` — not addressed here; `run_metadata.json` freezing at
  `"status": "running"` on a swallowed terminal write is PLAT-116's
  separate, still-open item.

## Process note

The first diagnosis was reached by reading logs and source, defended across
three rounds of further source-reading, and shipped twice — before anyone ran
the CLI. Two live runs (~2 minutes) refuted it. For this class of bug, **run the
real thing early**; absence of a log line is not absence of an event, especially
when the code under investigation is what decides whether that event is logged.
