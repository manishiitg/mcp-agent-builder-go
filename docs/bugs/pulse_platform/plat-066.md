- **Priority:** P1 — silently ran (part of) the wrong, real-world-effecting route on a live account
- **Owner:** step-based workflow orchestrator (`seedRouteSelectionsForRun`, `controller_routing_deterministic.go`) / `controller_execution.go:2943` call site
- **Found on:** social-media, 2026-08-10, session `schedule-cron--4128e261_1786329055349814000` ("Weekly Strategy Discovery (Proposer)")

## What happened

This ticket started as a live "Needs your decision" note the agent typed mid-run (never filed as a real decision — see the UI note below), which read: *"route_selections isn't plumbed through to step-run-mode-router. Until fixed, any non-default route request silently runs the execution pipeline."* Investigating it turned up a precise, reproducible mechanism, not just a description.

1. The schedule's message is explicit: `Call run_full_workflow(group_name="default", route_selections={"step-run-mode-router":"propose_new"})`. Confirmed the agent obeyed it exactly — the server log shows the actual HTTP payload sent: `{"group_name":"default","route_selections":{"step-run-mode-router":"propose_new"},"disable_eval":true}`.
2. Despite that, `runs/iteration-0/default/logs/step-run-mode-router/routing-evaluation.json` for this exact run records:
   ```json
   "route_selection": {"raw_value": "execution", "source_kind": "default_route_id", "source_path": ""},
   "routing_reasoning": "No route_selection.json found; using default_route_id \"execution\".",
   "selected_route_id": "execution"
   ```
   The router genuinely found no seeded route file and fell back to its default — **despite the caller having supplied the selection correctly.**
3. `seedRouteSelectionsForRun` (`controller_routing_deterministic.go:117`) is the function responsible for writing that file from `hcpo.executionOptions.RouteSelections`, and on success it logs `"🔀 Seeded deterministic route selection for %s: %s -> %s"`. That line **never appears anywhere in this session's logs.** Either the function was never called, or it returned before reaching that log line — but the caller-side data (`route_selections` in the tool payload) was present and correctly shaped, so this is not a caller error.
4. Consequence: the router took `execution` → `step-execution-pipeline` → `execute-allocate`, which ran and failed prevalidation (existing bug, `strategy_today.json` missing `per_run_budget`, open since 2026-07-30). The agent apparently noticed the misroute mid-session and separately, manually drove `propose-new-strategies-direct` to fulfil the schedule's actual intent (matching this workflow's own CLAUDE.md debugging instruction: *"don't just re-run it... run the task yourself... act, don't just analyze"*), leaving the wrongly-triggered execution-route job orphaned. `list_executions` later showed it stuck `status: "running"` under a `status: "cancelled"` parent, and the agent's own live attempt to stop it got contradictory answers — `"cannot be cancelled individually"` then `"No running executions found to cancel."` That bookkeeping inconsistency is closely related but is its own separate defect, not re-investigated in depth here.

## Why this matters beyond today

`step-run-mode-router`'s `default_route_id` was `"execution"` — the one route with real, public, live-account side effects (posting/replying/following). Compare `step-0-browser-router` two steps earlier in the same plan, whose default is `"browser_failed"` — i.e., when uncertain, stop. `step-run-mode-router` did the opposite: when its input silently failed to arrive, it defaulted to the most consequential action available, not the safest one. On a schedule that had explicitly promised *"Do not post, reply, like, follow, quote-tweet, or change the profile,"* this is the one case where the seeding gap actually could have caused real, uninstructed public actions if `execute-allocate` had not itself failed prevalidation on an unrelated, pre-existing bug.

**Interim mitigation already shipped (this session, commit `eaa089b`)**: removed `default_route_id` from `step-run-mode-router` in `plan.json`. A future seeding failure now makes the run **fail loudly** instead of silently executing the live-action route. This does not fix the seeding gap — it just converts a silent wrong-route execution into a visible error, which is the safe posture while the real cause is open.

## Investigation so far (root cause NOT isolated)

- Confirmed the caller-side payload was correct (see log line above) — ruling out an agent prompt-following failure.
- Confirmed the router itself saw no file — ruling out a routing-logic bug in how the router *reads* the file; the read path works as documented (`routing.md`: falls back to `default_route_id` when no file exists).
- Confirmed `seedRouteSelectionsForRun`'s own success-path log line never fired — meaning the write path did not complete, but not yet isolated to *why*: not called, called and returned early (`hcpo.executionOptions == nil` or `RouteSelections` empty at that point — inconsistent with the confirmed payload, so this would itself be a bug in how the payload becomes `executionOptions`), errored on `ensureStepExecutionFolderExists`/`WriteWorkspaceFile` (would need its own error log line, not found), or wrote to a **different run/step path** than the one the router later read from (a path-computation mismatch between the two call sites, both of which independently compute `getExecutionFolderPath(..., step.GetID(), stepPath)` from a `steps` list — worth checking whether both call sites see the same steps slice, in the same order, at the times they run).
- Not yet checked: whether `controller_execution.go:2943`'s call to `seedRouteSelectionsForRun` is itself reached for schedule/session-tool-triggered `run_full_workflow` calls the same way it is for the direct HTTP API path, or whether there's a second, divergent code path (mirroring the exact shape of PLAT-065's manual-vs-cron divergence, and the confirmed-dead `Schedule.RouteSelections` field found investigating that ticket — this codebase has more than one place where a route/config value is correctly modeled but not reliably wired through to where it's consumed).

**Diagnostic logging shipped (2026-08-10):** two log points now bracket the gap. `planning_exports.go`, right after `SetExecutionOptions` and before `CreateTodoList`, logs the parsed `route_selections` map whenever it's non-empty — confirming the value that actually reached the orchestrator's execution options at the top of the call. `seedRouteSelectionsForRun` (`controller_routing_deterministic.go:117`) now logs distinctly whether `executionOptions` was `nil` or `RouteSelections` was empty at seed time, instead of silently returning `nil` either way. Traced the parsing at `planning_exports.go:1854-1873` and confirmed it's structurally sound — malformed input returns an explicit tool error, which never fired for the incident run — and `SetExecutionOptions`/`CreateTodoList` are called synchronously on the same orchestrator instance, so the value is not obviously lost at either end I could directly verify. The gap is somewhere inside `CreateTodoList`'s internal call chain between that point and `runExecutionPhase`, which is too large to trace blind without risking a wrong guess in scheduler-critical code. The next occurrence's logs will show which of the two new log lines fired (or didn't), narrowing the search to a specific segment of that chain. Build and the existing 22-failure baseline both verified unaffected.

## UI note (unrelated defect, worth its own line)

The "Needs your decision" text that surfaced this had **no backing record** — `report_human_inputs` had zero pending/recent rows for this workspace at the time. The agent typed decision-card-styled prose without calling `create_human_input_request`, so nothing persisted for the UI to show and nothing was trackable/re-openable. Not filing a separate ticket for this alone since it's a single occurrence so far, but noting it because it's the same shape as PLAT-065's Gate→Finalize handoff gap: a described intention with no durable state behind it.

## Acceptance

- **Proven (2026-08-10):** the caller correctly supplied `route_selections`; the router correctly saw nothing; the seeding function's own success log never fired. The gap is real and reproducible in principle, not hypothetical.
- **Interim mitigation (done):** `default_route_id` removed from `step-run-mode-router` (commit `eaa089b`) — converts silent wrong-route execution into a loud failure.
- **Root cause (open):** isolate why `seedRouteSelectionsForRun` did not complete for this call, per the next-step diagnostic above.
- **Related, not yet investigated:** the orphaned `step-execution-pipeline` execution stuck reporting `"running"` under a cancelled parent, and `list_executions`/`stop_step` giving contradictory answers about it. May be a symptom of the same run, or a separate execution-bookkeeping defect — worth a dedicated look once the seeding root cause is found.
