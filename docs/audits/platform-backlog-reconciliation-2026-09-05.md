# Platform backlog reconciliation — 2026-09-05

Latest status: the [full remaining-report reconciliation](platform-open-report-reconciliation-2026-09-05.md)
subsequently reviewed all 96 remaining reports, resolved eight more exact cases,
and grouped the **88** still-open reports into **61 investigation scopes**.
The earlier counts below are dated intermediate snapshots, not the latest total.

## Subsequent verified fix/closure batch

The original inventory below is retained as a historical snapshot. After its
eight closures, seven additional exact findings are resolved, leaving **96 typed
harness findings** unresolved. Across today's original nine, subsequent eight,
and this seven, **24 of the original 120** have been closed. The 27 workflow
findings and ten unclassified candidates were not changed by this batch.

| Workflow | Finding | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| salesoutreach | PUL-4719B06D | PLAT-258 local fix: evidenced same-run correction atomically updates state and audit, preserving previous receipts |
| salesoutreach | PUL-09511B0E | PLAT-258 local fix: active child work blocks premature parent failure |
| salesoutreach | PUL-E3F22BCC | Conflicting child-session receipt checker removed in a8aaaa012; parent-run validation verified |
| hetznerssh | PUL-76329350 | Same retired receipt-checker defect |
| tectonicusadaytrading | PUL-F9BA8AF2 | Same retired receipt-checker defect |
| build-in-public | PUL-FF23BCD5 | PLAT-288 local fix: Workshop fast_path_only gate was inverted; saved-script safety checks retained |
| instagram | PUL-51D2EC0F | PLAT-061 superseded field: db_access was intentionally retired and never enforced the claimed grant |

Each closure preserves the full previous run_concerns row inside an append-only
platform_tracking_resolved event. Only issue-tracking status and its resolution
audit changed; business data, historical module receipts and live workflows did
not. New fixes are uncommitted/undeployed; no live end-to-end success is claimed.

Verification (all passed):

- Server + guidance: `Test.*(Pulse|ConversationTurn|DurableFailedWorkflow|PlanDrift)`.
- Workflow package: `TestWorkshopFastPath|Test.*Scripted|TestMergeAgentConfigFieldsCoversEveryField`.
- `TestWorkflowStepDatabaseToolsThroughMCPBridge`: actual built MCP bridge and
  workspace SQLite/WAL handlers; the test's custom HTTP facade models the
  success/result envelope. Native, MCP and once-decoded HTTP payloads match.
- `git diff --check`.

DB envelope reports PUL-25BDBC42, PUL-76F2EE72 and PUL-A14F764F remain open:
the documented transport distinction explains the two possible shapes, but it
does not establish which path each historical reported call used. Tool schema
and bridge guidance now explicitly explain the distinction. No DB engine fix
or historical failure reproduction is claimed.

## Scope and result

Compared and grouped the 111 remaining typed harness findings across 14 local workflow databases after the earlier nine closures. This is an engineering triage inventory, not 111 independently reproduced defects or a complete code audit of every report. Eight were verified stale/fixed or retired, resolved in SQLite, and read-back verified; 103 remain unresolved. The other 27 workflow issues and 10 unclassified candidates are outside this pass. No production code changes or workflow execution are part of this reconciliation.

## Verified closures

### PLAT-280

`PUL-01B1E294`, `PUL-439F126E`, `PUL-C796CD97`, `PUL-F7362B0B`.

Fix commit 371820e30; current plan types all four steps regular, effective configs declare scripted, saved main.py exists. prepareScriptedStepUpdateTarget supports conversion. TestPrepareScriptedStepUpdateTarget and TestConfigureWorkflowDBSessionRetainsScriptedCompatibility pass. Does not claim every possible future DB permission error fixed.

### PLAT-240

`PUL-57CFE46C`, `PUL-B1E9F611`.

Old record_pulse_verification tool removed (d9223aa61); no Go registration remains. Current RecordPulseFindingDispositionsTx uses caller-specified check_text with verification UPSERT and accepts verification without a pre-existing attempt. TestAppliedFixNeedsNoLaterVerificationAttempt, TestNoAttemptVerificationHistoryAccumulatesAcrossPulseRuns and TestFixedVerifiedDispositionWhitespaceStillClosesFinding pass. Retired exact old-tool defects, not all lifecycle bugs.

### PLAT-218

`PUL-D7D173FB`.

Fix commit a8aaaa012; report_human_inputs.go now distinguishes invalid outer objects from malformed approved_scope/post_run_proof string fields. Exact issue linked in ticket. TestReportHumanInputToolReportsExactInvalidApplyContractField and TestReportHumanInputPersistsStructuredApplyContract pass.

### PLAT-219

`PUL-5D2B9495`.

Fix commit a8aaaa012; conversation_turn_lifecycle.go probes exact linked full-run durable failure after inactivity rather than indefinitely trusting a running child. Exact issue linked in ticket. TestDurableFailedWorkflowDescendant, TestConversationTurn, TestRunFullWorkflow and TestWorkshopExecution pass. Does not close LinkedIn stale list projection, missed cron fires, or wrong-turn injection.

All closures are internal tracking resolutions backed by source and focused tests; fresh deployed end-to-end verification is not claimed. Prior SQLite records are retained in platform_tracking_resolved event metadata. Historical run outcomes and business data are untouched.

## Remaining triage groups

Groups below are investigation buckets, not proven shared root causes. Exact duplicates have not been merged and uncertain reports remain open.

| Group | Remaining findings |
|---|---:|
| Browser tools / shared sessions / site behavior | 17 |
| Costs / telemetry / historical attribution | 6 |
| DB response / validation contracts | 6 |
| Evaluation / validation lifecycle | 6 |
| Execution / tool / model / prompt contracts | 11 |
| External services / credentials (triage, not confirmed platform defects) | 3 |
| Filesystem / DB grants / output paths | 21 |
| Pulse lifecycle / findings / decision contracts | 18 |
| Scheduling / run identity / lifecycle | 15 |

## Next investigation order

1. Pulse premature failures and parent/child receipt identity: compare fresh paths against PLAT-199/258 and interrupted-review recovery before proposing another patch.
2. DB response envelopes: RTS PUL-25BDBC42 and Upwork PUL-76F2EE72/PUL-A14F764F are similar reports; reproduce both transports before consolidating.
3. Scheduling/retention: separate missing runs, wrong injected turns, lost retries and rotation. PLAT-219 and PLAT-242 do not cover all of them.
4. Folder grants: distinguish declared db/research/db/growth paths from supported db/assets and actual runtime grants. Do not loosen raw SQLite access.
5. Cost history: PLAT-226/241 are explicitly deferred; they must not be closed merely because other cost improvements landed.
6. Browser/external behavior and remaining tools: verify exact tab/session/tool contracts; upstream UI or credential failures are not automatically platform defects.

## Complete 111-record disposition inventory

Exact ticket matches below mean the ticket mentions the identifier/fingerprint; they do not prove that the issue is fixed. A dash means no exact link found, not no related ticket exists. Rows labeled "Resolve: verified fixed/retired" were subsequently applied and read-back verified in SQLite (8 total).

| Workflow | Issue | Disposition | Group | Exact ticket / verified mapping | Recorded symptom |

| build-in-public | PUL-FF23BCD5 | Open: needs further verification | Scheduling / run identity / lifecycle | — | execute_step(fast_path_only=true) rejects a regular plan step whose effective config declares scripted mode and whose saved main.py exists, so the schedule's deterministic preflight contract cannot execute through the published fast path. |
| hetznerssh | PUL-05A81CA0 | Open: needs further verification | Scheduling / run identity / lifecycle | — | route_selections passed to run_full_workflow no longer reach the routing step: the preseed file execution/run-remediation-route/route_selection.json is not written, so run-remediation-route silently falls back to default_route_id. |

| tectonicusadaytrading | PUL-3E984942 | Open: needs further verification | Scheduling / run identity / lifecycle | — | 9db4dc39 intermittently fails to fire all 3 scheduled slots on a given day, no backfill; owner=platform, external_action_required. |
| tectonicusadaytrading | PUL-F9BA8AF2 | Open: needs further verification | Pulse lifecycle / findings / decision contracts | — | Pulse review receipt attribution uses two conflicting id conventions in the same contract: record_pulse_result must be called with the parent pulse_run_id, but the background-child completion gate looks the receipt up by the child sessio... |
| tectonicusadaytrading | PUL-B1E9F611 | Resolve: verified fixed/retired | Verified already-fixed / retired | PLAT-240 | record_pulse_verification requires a pending internal attempt to resolve, but the Pulse review/Fixer contract's split (reviewer marks review done, a later Fixer applies repairs) means many genuinely-fixed issues never get one, permanentl... |

| upwork | PUL-7B849CC6 | Open: needs further verification | Scheduling / run identity / lifecycle | — | run_full_workflow dropped the search-find-and-shortlist human_inputs override, so the Aug 3 search scanned Most Recent despite an explicit two-feed run limit |

| upwork | PUL-F2B4C57F | Open: needs further verification | Costs / telemetry / historical attribution | — | Unchanged root, re-open condition CHECKED this pass and NOT met. The recorded re-measurement stands: the missing-metadata half is a harness measurement gap the workflow cannot write, not a contribution-yield problem. |
| upwork | PUL-D50AD8BC | Open: needs further verification | Pulse lifecycle / findings / decision contracts | — | record_run_concern is not registered in the step-runner tool profile, so a step that discovers a durable engineering defect mid-run has no way to file it and must downgrade the finding to a free-text CONCERNS line. |

| upwork | PUL-A9401F93 | Open: needs further verification | Scheduling / run identity / lifecycle | — | The intermittent scheduler-silent-skip root remains unclosed, but 2026-08-27 produced real schedule-run records and retained run folders for both affected schedules, so the current failures are not silent skips. |
