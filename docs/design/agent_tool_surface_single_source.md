# Agent tool surface: one source of truth

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-08-08
**Supersedes:** [product_tool_registration_and_visibility.md](product_tool_registration_and_visibility.md)
**Related:** [canonical_agent_definition_construction.md](../refactor/canonical_agent_definition_construction.md)

## Problem

"What tools does this agent have?" is answered in five places today, in three
different styles. A tool must survive all of them, and any one of them can
silently drop it.

| Tool group | Decision lives in | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Product tools (`video.show-video`) | `product.yaml` `tools:` → `agent_profile_runtime.go:211` | opt-in, YAML |
| Platform pools (workspace, media/LLM, skills, MCP) | `product.yaml` `tool_policy.disabled` → `agent_profile_runtime.go:234`, four call sites (`server.go:4590,5002,5011,5029`) | opt-out, YAML |
| Workflow tools (`query_step`, `execute_step`, `run_full_workflow`, …) | hardcoded Go map `agentProfileWorkflowToolNames`, `agent_profile_workflow.go:21-29` | opt-in, Go |
| Secret tools (`list_secrets`, `set_user_secret`, …) | no policy at all — always registered, `server.go:5041` | always on |
| `createCustomTools` pool | no profile check, `server.go:~4891` | always on |

On top of that sits a second, independent list: `GetToolsForWorkshopMode()`
(`interactive_workshop_manager.go:1473`), applied per turn via `SetToolPolicy`
→ `mcpagent.Turn.ToolPolicy.AllowedTools`.

### The same bug has now happened three times

- **Video Studio secrets.** `set_user_secret` / `set_workflow_secret` were
  registered but absent from the workshop-mode list. The agent could not call
  them or discover them via `get_api_spec`, and fell back to a shell bridge
  Video Studio deliberately disables.
- **`list_llm_capabilities`.** Same shape, documented in the code at
  `interactive_workshop_manager.go:1494-1497`: *"a real, registered tool was
  rejected … Registration and this list live in different files, which is how
  they drifted."*
- **Builder background child (2026-08-08).** Failed at registration instead:
  the child called `prepareCustomTools(nil)` while the parent registered a
  richer workshop surface.

`toolset_invariant_test.go:12-33` exists only to hold two hand-maintained lists
in sync. It is a band-aid over the design, not a fix.

## The key asymmetry

A coding CLI caches its tool catalog **once, at launch**, via `get_api_spec`
(`chat_history_routes.go:143`). From that follows:

- **Removing** a tool the agent already knows about degrades gracefully — it
  calls, gets an error, adapts. `guidance.go:360` already does this well:
  *"error: kind %q is not available in mode %q … Tell the user they need to
  switch workshop mode."*
- **Adding** a tool after launch is invisible. The agent cannot ask for what it
  was never told exists, so it shells out instead.

**You can always take away. You can never add.**

This is why filtering the catalog is dangerous. `GetToolsForWorkshopMode` does
not only reject calls — it filters `buildToolIndex()` / `get_api_spec`, i.e. the
catalog read at launch. An exclusion applied there is indistinguishable from
never registering the tool: no discovery, no error, silent shell fallback. That
is exactly how the secrets bug became unrecoverable.

## Design

Three rules.

1. **One source of truth.** A single declarative list per agent role decides
   what is registered. Registration is complete before the CLI launches.
2. **Never filter the catalog.** `get_api_spec` and the tool index render
   everything registered. Discovery is always complete.
3. **Focus rules live in the prompt; code enforces authority only.**

The agent then always knows what exists. Nothing can silently vanish.

### What code may still enforce

| Rule type | Example | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Focus / workflow discipline | "don't optimize while still building" | Prompt — the agent decides |
| Authority | a reviewer must not mutate the workflow DB | Code — executor check |
| Irreversible / external | spend, delete, send outward | Code — executor check |

The test is whether this is something the agent should not be *trusted* to
decide, or merely something it might get wrong. Only the first belongs in Go.
Reviewer-cannot-mutate protects the reviewer/fixer separation and is exactly
what the canonical doc's Reader/Writer contract exists for. "Which workshop mode
am I in" is not that — and encoding it in Go duplicates a rule the system prompt
already states, which is the same one-decision-two-places failure this document
exists to remove.

### Relationship to the canonical refactor

[canonical_agent_definition_construction.md](../refactor/canonical_agent_definition_construction.md)
fixes drift *across construction paths* (parent vs child, scheduled vs
converted-chat) via one `AgentDefinition`. This document fixes drift *across
consumers within one path* (registered vs agent-visible vs API spec).

The canonical doc's Reader/Writer contract cannot express this axis — "this tool
exists for the HTTP UI but not for the agent" and "this tool is unavailable on
this provider" are not authority facts. The declarative list below is the
missing input to its canonical constructor, not a competing model.

## Fix: Video Studio

Gate 2 is already inert here — `workflow_phase_tools.go:449` takes the
`setToolPolicy(nil)` branch for non-Builder phases. So Video Studio becomes a
genuine one-gate system with no runtime work.

1. **Extend `ToolPolicy`** (`agent_go/pkg/agentprofiles/types.go:88-90`):

   ```go
   type ToolPolicy struct {
       Mode     string   `yaml:"mode,omitempty"`     // "allowlist" | "" (legacy deny)
       Enabled  []string `yaml:"enabled,omitempty"`
       Disabled []string `yaml:"disabled,omitempty"` // retained for other profiles
   }
   ```

2. **Add one registrar gate.** Follow the existing working pattern —
   `agentProfileWorkflowRegistrar` (`agent_profile_workflow.go:30-77`) already
   wraps `definitionToolRegistrar` and gates every registration by name:

   ```go
   type productToolGate struct {
       target   definitionToolRegistrar
       allowed  map[string]struct{}
       filtered []string
   }
   ```

   This works regardless of which pool a tool came from, because every path
   funnels through `RegisterCustomTool`.

3. **Pass the gate instead of `llmAgent`** into every `register*Tools(...)`
   call. All of them already accept the `definitionToolRegistrar` interface —
   `registerSecretManagementTools` (`secrets_tools.go:31`),
   `registerMultiAgentLLMTools` (`multiagent_llm_tools.go:1163`),
   `registerAgentProfileTools` (`agent_profile_runtime.go:211`) — so this is
   wiring, not refactoring.

4. **Retire the redundant mechanisms**: `tool_policy.disabled` for this profile,
   the `agentProfileWorkflowToolNames` map, and the always-on secrets
   special-case. They collapse into the one `enabled:` list.

5. **Log every filtered tool** at session start. An allowlist fails closed, so a
   missing capability must be diagnosable from logs rather than from confused
   agent behavior.

Result in `product.yaml`:

```yaml
tool_policy:
  mode: allowlist
  enabled:
    - video.show-video
    - list_secrets
    - set_workflow_secret
    - delete_workflow_secret
    - query_step
    - execute_step
    - run_full_workflow
```

### Building the list safely

Do not guess it. Run a real Video Studio session, capture the effective set from
the existing log lines (`[CUSTOM TOOLS] Registered custom tool: %s`,
`[WORKSPACE TOOLS] Registering %d workspace tools`), seed `enabled:` from that,
confirm behavior is unchanged, then trim. Behavior-preserving first, minimal
second.

## Fix: AgentWorks (Workflow Builder)

Higher risk — it touches every workflow — so it comes second.

**Delete gate 2.** Workshop-mode narrowing goes away entirely. Mode discipline
moves to the system prompt, which already describes the modes.

There are only two call sites:

- `workflow_phase_tools.go:449-458` (the mode if/else), plus the `setToolPolicy`
  parameter threaded in from `server.go:5566`
- `interactive_workshop_manager.go:1925`

plus `GetToolsForWorkshopMode()` itself (`interactive_workshop_manager.go:1473`)
and the exception list in `toolset_invariant_test.go:12-33`.

### Why not keep it as call-time rejection

Because the allow-list drives two unrelated surfaces. `mcpagent`'s
`agent/turn_session.go:186-192`:

```go
allowed := policy.allowedMap()
codeexec.SetSessionToolAllowList(s.agent.sessionID, allowed)
```

- **Surface A** — the tool list offered to the model this turn
  (`agent/agent.go:3622`). The intended use.
- **Surface B** — the **session-wide** code-execution HTTP registry, which
  execution agents and sub-agents call from generated `main.py`.

Surface B is keyed by session, not by actor. Narrowing the Builder's tools to
enforce its workshop mode therefore also narrows the HTTP bridge for every other
actor in that session. That is why four unrelated names are pinned in the
always-allowed block at `interactive_workshop_manager.go:1499-1502` — not
because modes should permit them, but because omitting them broke execution
agents.

Two consequences make this unfixable in place:

1. **The rule is inexpressible.** "The Builder LLM should not call sub-agents in
   this mode" cannot be stated, because stating it also disables sub-agent calls
   for execution agents.
2. **There is a hidden maintenance obligation.** Any tool any execution agent
   might ever call over HTTP must also appear in the Builder's mode list, or it
   silently breaks — a coupling invisible from either file, and on top of the
   registration drift that caused the three incidents.

### Honest tradeoff

Mode discipline becomes advisory: the LLM sees every registered tool and follows
the prompt. A model may occasionally act out of phase. That is a visible,
recoverable error — versus the current failure, where a tool silently disappears
and the agent quietly shells out instead. Builder prompts should state the mode
boundaries explicitly, since they become the only place the rule lives.

## Sequencing

1. Video Studio gate + `enabled:` list (isolated, gate 2 inert, small blast radius)
2. AgentWorks: delete gate 2; move mode boundaries into the Builder prompts
3. Keep executor-level authority checks (Reader/Writer, irreversible actions)
4. Delete superseded mechanisms and the invariant band-aid

Steps 1 and 2 independently close a shipped bug class and can land separately.

## Verification

- **Video Studio:** run a session; assert the filtered-tool log is empty of
  anything expected; confirm secret tools and workflow tools appear in
  `get_api_spec`; store and read back a workflow secret through the real bridge.
- **AgentWorks:** in each workshop mode, assert every registered tool appears in
  `get_api_spec`; assert a mode-blocked call returns the actionable error rather
  than being absent.
- **Invariant test (replaces the exception list):** for every profile, the set
  in `get_api_spec` equals the set actually registered. No hand-maintained
  membership list.

## Open questions

1. Skills register through `AttachSkill`, a separate method. In scope for the
   gate, or governed separately?
2. Provider-native tools (`agent_tools: mode: hybrid`) never reach this
   registrar — the CLI supplies its own file/shell tools. They stay governed by
   `approvals`. Confirm no product expects the list to cover them.
3. MCP bridge tools carry their own `MCPToolPolicy`
   (`productdeps/dependencies.go:89`). Verify whether that is a fourth
   registration path needing the same gate.
