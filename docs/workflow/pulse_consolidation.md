## Current architecture (2026-08)

Pulse is a **dynamic post-run steward**, not a fixed checklist. After each
scheduled run it runs a small sequence with one mandatory intelligence turn:

1. **Gate / Worklist.** One turn reads the run evidence (run summary, `CONCERNS:`
   markers, changelog, eval/report/DB/KB/learnings state, human inputs, Chief of
   Staff recommendations, cost/tier signals, and the store freshness ledgers) and
   calls `record_pulse_worklist` exactly once with one `due|skipped` decision for
   each of three agents: `workflow_review`, `strategy_auditor`, and
   `goal_advisor`. Go enforces the complete-worklist rule, every skip carries a
   next-check condition, and Gate mutates nothing. Historical operational IDs
   remain accepted as aliases and are projected into `workflow_review`; current
   passes never schedule them separately.
2. **Three independent read-only agents.** `workflow_review` is one continuous
   agent context with ordered checkpoints for correctness/QA, plan and artifact
   drift, reports/evals, stores, and cost/model/tool/runtime operations. It loads
   shared plan, run, goal, lifecycle, and cost evidence once and semantically
   deduplicates findings across those lenses. `strategy_auditor` separately asks
   what is missing or ineffective inside the selected strategy.
   `goal_advisor` separately performs the less-frequent blank-sheet search for a
   materially different approach. None consumes another reviewer's conclusion.
   All due agents may run concurrently (maximum three), and the scheduler waits
   at one barrier before starting the Fixer.
3. **Single Pulse Fixer.** The parent turn is the **only writer**. It consolidates
   findings, resolves conflicts by a fixed precedence, applies bounded safe fixes
   sequentially, and verifies each against the single `fix-verification` contract
   (a successful write is never proof; a fix stays `changed_unverified` until a
   real run/eval/report confirms it). Strategy/LLM changes remain proposal-only
   behind the human-input approval flow.
   SQLite is authoritative for the per-finding lifecycle: `run_concerns` files
   and deduplicates findings, `pulse_fix_attempts` plus
   `pulse_fix_attempt_findings` record the mutation boundary,
   `pulse_fix_verifications` records passed/failed/inconclusive proof, and
   `pulse_finding_events` records filed/fixing/closed/reopened history. Complete
   reviewer Markdown is stored as human-readable SQLite TEXT in
   `pulse_review_log`; it is evidence, not the close/reopen state. The Pulse popup
   is one database-native workspace: aggregate health, pending decisions, compact
   Goal context, cross-module findings, recent lifecycle activity, module
   reviews, fix/verification detail, and finalization status. Raw Markdown is a
   secondary evidence view. The popup does not extract or display fragments from
   `builder/improve.html`.
4. **Longitudinal impact ledger.** The Fixer records interventions, immutable
   per-run success-criterion observations, and append-only before/after impact
   assessments in SQLite. Reliability, measurement, and presentation work are
   explicitly separated from direct goal impact. The Pulse popup projects the
   latest criterion values and improved/regressed/inconclusive/awaiting counts;
   later passes add evidence instead of overwriting earlier conclusions.
5. **One ordered finalizer.** dashboard → backup → publish → notify, each recording
   its own live/final status. The scheduler marks anything left running as failed.

The dedicated Dashboard stage still owns `builder/improve.html`. That file remains
the full generated Pulse dashboard, archive-linked time-series report, and
publishable artifact. Moving reviewer evidence and lifecycle state into SQLite
does not retire or replace it.

Workflow contract v1.0.17 non-destructively imports recognized historical
`pulse/reviews/**/*.md` into `pulse_review_log` and keeps the source files during
the compatibility window. New Pulse reviewers write their complete Markdown
directly to SQLite and create no review file. The popup falls back to retained
legacy files only when a workflow has no matching database review yet.

Standalone Pulse-module slash commands use the same path. `/bug-review`,
`/ops-review`, `/strategy-auditor`, and `/review-artifact-drift` pass their
canonical module to `call_generic_agent`; Go generates manual run identities,
stores the full Markdown in `pulse_review_log`, and indexes `CONCERNS:` into the
finding lifecycle before the parent updates `builder/improve.html`.
`/goal-advisor` calls the native Advisor → Critic → Finalizer pipeline directly;
that pipeline persists its complete result and remaining concerns the same way.

Goal Advisor is a Pulse-selected module (not a separate schedule). Recovery,
timeout, and concurrency are hardened in Go: a trusted-session registry binds each
logical Pulse run (recovery sessions included) so only the owning session can write
its module/worklist/final-command state, agent writes are compare-and-set against
the recorded run and never overwrite a scheduler-recorded terminal state, and a
boot sweep reconciles final commands stranded by a crash.

**Store freshness (2026-07).** A code-owned ledger (`learnings/_global/_freshness.json`,
`knowledgebase/_freshness.json`) records when each store — and each reference
file / topic note — was last confirmed by a run, stamped by the runtime at the
learnings/KB contribution turns (not LLM-maintained, so it can't desync). Gate
marks `stores_health` due on a confirmation-recency
signal, and the reviewer re-verifies → refreshes / demotes / retires aging
knowledge (never deletes on age alone). This adds a *time/decay* axis to what was
previously only contradiction-driven staleness.

## Historical migration record (2026-06)

Status at the time: **Implemented** (2026-06-21) — Phase 1 (rename) + Phase 2 (backup-always +
Pulse-does-low-risk-fixes). Auto-fix was intentionally scoped to low-risk reversible
harden; bigger `replan` changes stayed with the scheduled auto-improve loop. (Both
the fixed 4-step pipeline and the separate auto-improve loop below were later
replaced by the dynamic Gate/worklist model in **Current architecture**.)

## Pulse vs the auto-improve loop (division of labor)

These are two tiers over the same Pulse log / Bug-Goal vocabulary — they compose,
they don't overlap:

- **Pulse** — runs after **every** run (when enabled). Cheap + immediate: **back up →
  triage → apply a low-risk reversible Bug harden → record a Goal replan *proposal* →
  notify.** Never runs `replan` or a full improvement pass itself.
- **Auto-improve loop** — a **separate schedule** (`/auto-improve`, optimizer mode).
  Owns the **bigger changes**: batched harden and the **`replan`** tool for structural
  plan rewrites, acting on the proposals Pulse recorded. Pulse is skipped after these
  optimizer-mode runs (`scheduler.go`: `WorkshopMode != "optimizer"`), so the two never
  fight over the same run.

## Problem

After a run there are **four disconnected mechanisms**, with different triggers,
gating, and reliability:

1. **Post-run monitor** (`runPostRunMonitor`, `scheduler.go:1164`) — opt-in
   (`post_run_monitor`), a dedicated agent pass that writes the Pulse log
   (`builder/improve.html` time-stamped Signal / Reflection / Improvement history; Goal / Ikigai comes from `soul/soul.md`). Its final notify/summary step
   writes the `builder/card.health.html` dashboard card after harden, artifact review,
   cost/time, backup, and publish are known. Auto-improve **cadence #1**.
2. **Scheduled harden** — auto-improve **cadence #2**, applies low-risk Bug fixes on
   its own schedule.
3. **Scheduled replan-proposal** — auto-improve **cadence #3**, proposes Goal changes.
4. **Backup** (`workflowRunBackupDirective`, `background_agents.go:1607`) — a directive
   appended to the builder's AUTO-NOTIFICATION after a `run_full_workflow` completion.
   Best-effort steering, **not** a guaranteed step; scheduled runs don't back up
   themselves (`scheduler.go:1268`).

Naming reality: the monitor reference doc already calls `builder/improve.html`
"**the Pulse log**". So "monitor" (the pass) and "Pulse" (the log) are two halves of
one feature that was never unified in the UI.

## Decisions (user, 2026-06-21)

1. **Pulse everywhere.** The feature/toggle is named **Pulse**. The right-panel tab is
   **Pulse** (reverts the Phase-3 "History" rename). Internally the monitor pass becomes
   the "Pulse pass."
2. **Full auto.** Enabling **Pulse** runs the complete post-run loop **every run**:
   **back up → triage → apply fixes (harden for Bug, replan for Goal)**. The four
   mechanisms above collapse into this one toggle.

## Target model

```
Pulse (one toggle) → after every run:
  1. Back up        — always, guaranteed (local-git default = zero-config). Skipped only
                      when source_hash is unchanged (no empty commits).
  2. Triage         — the current monitor: Bug + Goal verdicts, Pulse log, verdict signal.
  3. Fix            — Bug → harden (low-risk reliability/contract fixes);
                      Goal → replan (now applied, was propose-only).
  4. Notify         — one transition notification (unchanged policy).
Pulse tab (UI) → the durable record: Timeline (improve.html) + Plan edits (changelog).
```

Backup is no longer a separate steering directive; it's step 1 of the Pulse pass and
runs in the scheduler post-run block where the monitor already lives.

## Changes required

### UI (rename — safe, mechanical)
- `WorkflowCanvas.tsx`: tab label + titles "History" → **"Pulse"** (revert Phase 3).
- `HistoryView.tsx` → `PulseView.tsx` (component rename; keeps Timeline + Plan edits
  sub-tabs). `PlanChangelogFeed.tsx` unchanged.
- `WorkflowToolbar.tsx`: the monitor toggle (`monitorOn`) relabels to **"Pulse"**.

### Behavior (the real change — needs care)
- `runPostRunMonitor` → `runPulse` (or keep name, expand prompt). Add **backup as step 1**
  (guaranteed, source-hash gated) and **fix as step 3** (harden + replan).
- Rewrite `guidance/templates/system/post-run-monitor.md`: it is no longer read-only —
  it backs up, then triages, then applies the safe fixes. Reconcile with the existing
  harden / replan reference docs so there's one fix contract, not three.
- `scheduler.go`: backup runs here for scheduled runs (always). Remove / demote the
  `workflowRunBackupDirective` steering path so backup isn't double-driven.
- `PostRunMonitor` manifest flag stays the gate but is surfaced as "Pulse enabled".

### Risk / open
- **Auto-fix every run changes the safety model.** Cadences #1–#3 were deliberately
  separated (cheap read-only triage vs riskier fixes on a slower schedule). Folding them
  means a fix can land on every run. Mitigation: keep harden's "low-risk only" contract;
  keep replan as the heavier action and decide whether it truly applies or still proposes
  for high-risk plan rewrites. **To confirm before the behavioral rewrite ships.**
- Cost: every run now does backup + triage + (sometimes) fix instead of a cheap triage.
  Acceptable per the "full auto" decision, but worth a source-hash / no-op fast path.

## Backup visibility (2026-06-21)
Backup surfaces in three places now: the toolbar status dot + the Backup popup
(existing), and — added here — the **Pulse log Run row**. Since Pulse owns the backup,
its step-3 Run row records the backup result (`backed up ✓ <commit>` /
`unchanged — already backed up` / `backup ✗ <reason>`). Doc-only change to
`post-run-monitor.md` (step 3) and `review-improve-log.md` (Run kind) — agent-driven,
no Go.

## Phasing
1. **Rename to Pulse** ✅ Done (2026-06-21, UI only). `WorkflowCanvas` tab + titles
   "History" → "Pulse"; `HistoryView.tsx` → `PulseView.tsx`; toolbar "Monitor" button +
   help popup → "Pulse" (internal vars `monitorOn`/`post_run_monitor` unchanged).
   Verified: tsc 0, lints clean.
2. **Backup always + Pulse does low-risk fixes** ✅ Done (2026-06-21). Rewrote the
   Pulse pass prompt in `scheduler.go` (`runPostRunMonitor`) to the 4-step contract
   (back up → triage → low-risk harden / replan-proposal → notify) and rewrote
   `guidance/templates/system/post-run-monitor.md` to match (new "0. Back up first" +
   "3b. Apply the fix" sections; dropped the strict read-only framing; kept step 5 =
   Notify so the prompt's reference still resolves). Backend build + vet OK.
   Safety rails kept: **low-risk reversible fixes only** (bigger work → auto-improve
   loop), and **source-hash gate** so steady runs skip the push.

3. **Unify the backup directive** ✅ Done (2026-06-21). `workflowRunBackupDirective`
   (the interactive arm) now shares **one backup contract** with Pulse's step 1: same
   zero-config local-git default, same source-hash skip. So the two arms (Pulse =
   scheduled, directive = interactive + Pulse-off fallback) can't double-push — whichever
   runs second sees the source already backed up and skips. Stale `scheduler.go:1268`
   comment corrected. Build + vet OK; no test pinned the old wording.

   **Non-goal (decided 2026-06-21):** do NOT move the source-hash skip into deterministic
   Go code. The whole post-run/backup loop stays agent-driven — the agent reads
   `backup/status.json` and decides. No Go-side gating coupling.

## Phase 4 — Publish folded into the Pulse loop (2026-06-24)

Publish (the public-URL twin of Backup — see `docs/workflow/publish_design.md`) is now a
step of the Pulse pass, so a workflow's public dashboard stays current automatically:

```
Pulse → after every run:
  1. Back up    — guaranteed, source-hash gated (unchanged).
  2. Triage     — Bug + Goal verdicts, Pulse log (unchanged).
  3. Fix        — low-risk harden / replan proposal (unchanged).
  4. Re-publish — ONLY if publish is configured + enabled; rebuilds from source and
                  redeploys both artifacts. Skipped when publish is off.
  5. Notify     — one transition notification (unchanged).
```

`post-run-monitor.md` gained a "### 4b. Re-publish (only if publish is on)" section. Like
backup, publish is **agent-driven and read-only in the UI**: setup/run/restore/publish all
happen in the builder chat via the **`/backup`** and **`/publish`** slash commands; the
toolbar popups are status-only. The dead write endpoints (`/workflow/{backup,publish}/{config,run}`)
were removed.

### Publish output contract (what `/publish` ships)
- **Both artifacts, always** — the baked report **dashboard** (`dashboard.html`) AND the
  **Pulse log** (`pulse.html`, from `builder/improve.html`), joined by a top-nav
  `index.html` wrapper (Dashboard | Pulse tabs). Publishing only one is a bug.
- **Dark only, matching the app** — the published pages must set **both** theming hooks on
  `<html>`: `class="dark"` (the app's Tailwind mechanism, `ThemeContext`) **and**
  `data-theme="dark"` (what report widgets `HtmlWidgetFrame` and the Pulse-log skeleton
  key on). Setting only `data-theme` left the dashboard light, because report widgets key
  primarily off the `.dark` class. No toggle, no `prefers-color-scheme` (that follows the
  viewer's OS). See `[[project_published_page_theme_contract]]`.
- **Stage outside the workspace** — deploy CLIs (`netlify`, `vercel`, …) write state
  (`.netlify/`, `.vercel/`) to their CWD. The workflow folder is writable EXCEPT
  `planning/`, but the CLI's CWD is often the docs root (above the folder, outside the
  write allow-list), so it gets rejected. Copy the finished static files to
  `/tmp/publish-<workflow>/` and run the deploy from there.

### Plan-edits consolidation (2026-06-24)
The toolbar **Plan edits** popup (the granular `planning/changelog/*.json` audit feed) got a
**Consolidate** control — drop edits older than 7/30/90/180 days — backed by
`POST /workflow/plan-changelog/prune`. The server prunes (deletes whole `changelog-*.json`
files older than the cutoff) because `planning/` is shell-guarded from the agent.
