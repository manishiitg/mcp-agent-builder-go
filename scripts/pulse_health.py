"""Pulse health / loop diagnostic across every workflow's Pulse state.

Answers one question: **is Pulse converging, or looping?**

The loop this exists to measure: a fix reaches `changed_unverified` ->
`awaiting_verification`, which only a producing run can settle. If runs keep
dying (PLAT-054), evidence never arrives, the next pass re-examines the same
finding, re-fixes it, and still cannot prove it. Upwork's baseline showed 91
`fix_started` against 69 `closed` with 64 `verification_inconclusive` -- that
ratio is the loop rendered as counts.

Sections:
  1. LOOP HEALTH    -- per workflow: closure rate, verification debt, recurrence
  2. CATEGORY       -- findings grouped by classification/issue_kind + step spread
  3. COHERENCE      -- contradictory states Go cannot retroactively repair
  4. UNTRIAGED      -- external_action_required findings citing no PLAT-NNN

Usage:
    python3 scripts/pulse_health.py                       # full report
    python3 scripts/pulse_health.py --json baseline.json  # + write a snapshot
    python3 scripts/pulse_health.py --baseline baseline.json   # + cohort diff

**Read the cohort diff, not the totals.** Reviewer lenses can be disabled at the
Gate (currently: only `workflow_review` runs), which lowers the finding count on
its own and has nothing to do with whether a platform fix worked. `--baseline`
tracks the specific fingerprints that were open at baseline and reports how many
of *those* closed, which survives a lens being switched off. Filing rate is
reported separately, per module, so a drop caused by a disabled lens is
visible as such.

Always read-only: every database is opened with mode=ro.

    session's turn ended. Nothing else was ever going to pick it up — Gate's own
    contract forbids it from launching reviewers itself, and the architecture
    has "no scheduler-launched residual or recovery Fixer" by design, so a
    dropped handoff here is silent by construction. It sat unactioned for hours

    different workflow (upwork) completed its own due->result cycle normally,
    so this is not a universal failure of the mechanism — root cause not yet
    isolated (manual vs cron trigger path is the leading, unconfirmed lead).

    A "due" decision is stranded when last_gate_decision='due' and last_result
    is empty (no Review+Fix pass has ever written a result for it) and enough
    time has passed that a normal review would have finished. Short-lived empty
