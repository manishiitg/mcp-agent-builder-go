// The packaged app serves the frontend from the same origin as the API, so the

// backend() reports 'platform': M1 of
// docs/design/sparkquill_desktop_on_platform_plan.md moved the shell off the
// standalone family-server onto the AgentWorks platform binaries
// (workspace-server + agent-server), which is what the learning app's
// existing platform-mode client (api/index.ts, platform/runtimeConfig.ts)
// already targets.
//
// onWindowVisibility lets the app free the speech model when the window is
// hidden and warm it again on show (main.js sends the event; the app holds
// the login token the platform's /api/voice/* routes need).
