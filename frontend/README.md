# AI Agent Streaming Frontend

A React-based frontend for real-time AI agent conversations with multi-server MCP support.

## Features

- **Real-time Event Streaming**: Live display of agent activities and tool calls
- **Multi-Server MCP Support**: Connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
- **Event Mode Toggle**: Switch between Basic and Advanced event display modes
- **Tool Management**: Enable/disable specific tools from different MCP servers
- **Agent Modes**: Support for Simple and ReAct agent modes
- **Preset Queries**: Quick access to common query templates
- **Settings Panel**: Configure agent parameters and tool preferences

## Event Display Modes

### Basic Mode (Default)
Shows only essential events for a cleaner experience:
- `tool_call_start` - When a tool begins execution
- `tool_call_end` - When a tool completes execution
- `llm_generation_start` - When LLM generation begins
- `llm_generation_end` - When LLM generation completes
- `react_reasoning_end` - When ReAct reasoning completes
- `conversation_end` - When conversation ends
- `agent_end` - When agent completes
- `conversation_error` - When conversation encounters an error
- `agent_error` - When agent encounters an error
- `fallback_model_used` - When a fallback model is used
- `large_tool_output_detected` - When large tool outputs are detected

### Advanced Mode
Shows all events for detailed debugging and monitoring:
- All basic mode events
- Debug events
- Performance metrics
- Token usage details
- Detailed spans
- System prompts
- User messages
- And more...

## Getting Started
