 * A readable progress update emitted by a coding-agent transport. This is a
 * structured event, rather than a rendered terminal/tmux frame.
 *
 * Rendered as plain muted text, not a card: it reads as the agent's running
 * commentary between the user's message and the answer (user request,
 * 2026-09-03). Token-streamed fragments are folded into one event upstream
 * (utils/thinkingDeltas.ts), so one of these is one thinking span.
