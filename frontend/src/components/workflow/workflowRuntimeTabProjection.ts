 * accumulates that many tabs, including across a reload — see
 * selectDurableChatState's persistence filter, which no longer excludes
 * finished Schedule tabs either.
 *
 * What now bounds the accumulation is tab *reuse*, not closing: a new run of
 * a schedule takes over that schedule's finished tab (see
 * utils/workflowTabResolution.ts), so a schedule keeps one tab however often
 * it fires. staleWorkflowTabIds below is a time-based close that is not
 * currently wired up -- see the note in WorkflowChatTabs for why.
