 * Two layers (docs/design/user_accounts_and_workflow_sharing.md): the
 * account decides whether the user may create or edit anything at all, and
 * — when a `workspacePath` is given — the workflow's own owner/reader lists
 * decide whether THIS workflow is theirs to edit. A workflow shared
 * read-only is read-only even for a member who owns others.
 *
 * The toolbar keeps capability views visible for readers, while the
 * capabilities panel hides its Save button and the section components
 * underneath disable their writes. Those components may write account-wide
 * state immediately (bot routes, API keys, secrets, skills, MCP connections)
 * and can be reachable through surfaces that never pass through the toolbar,
 * so every mutating control must honor this guard.
