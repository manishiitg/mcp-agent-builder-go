- If publish is NOT configured: set it up — ask me which static host (Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages / Cloudflare R2 / S3 / any). As soon as I pick one, AUTO-CHECK its CLI (command -v) and INSTALL it for me if missing (announce it, e.g. "Installing the Vercel CLI…", then run npm i -g <cli>); do NOT ask me for an access token/API key — the path is install CLI → I run <cli> login once → you deploy. Default visibility is PRIVATE via a simple password gate (StatiCrypt with $SECRET_PUBLISH_PASSWORD and the Runloop dark gate styling from the reference doc); ask me to set a PUBLISH_PASSWORD secret, or confirm if I want it fully public instead. Then write workflow.json.publish and publish/status.json with state "configured_not_verified". Do not publish yet.
- If publish IS configured: publish the report dashboard now. Deploy dashboard.html and the nav index.html wrapper per the reference doc. Pulse is in-app only and must not be published as a separate artifact. Force every page to **DARK only** (matching the app) — set BOTH class="dark" and data-theme="dark" on the html element per the reference doc; no toggle, do NOT use prefers-color-scheme. Stage the files in a /tmp dir; if visibility is private, encrypt them with StatiCrypt ($SECRET_PUBLISH_PASSWORD) and apply the Runloop dark password-gate styling before deploying; run the deploy CLI from /tmp. Then give me the URL and confirm visibility + what's public.
CRITICAL — after deploying, come BACK to the workflow folder and persist state there (never in the /tmp staging dir): set workflow.json.publish.enabled=true with the destination + top-level url, AND write publish/status.json with state "published", the url, and last_source_hash (= the current_source_hash the backend reports; leave empty if unknown). A deploy that doesn't write these shows a grey "not configured" dot even though the site is live.

      const instruction = `Help me set up or review notifications for this workflow.
- First read the current workflow configuration. Explain the current effective destinations, saved notification instructions, and whether the Slack webhook secret reference is healthy. Never reveal or write a webhook URL to workflow.json, prompts, logs, or ordinary files.
- Notifications are agentic: the agent decides when a non-blocking FYI, alert, progress update, or completion notice is useful and chooses the content. Delivery is deterministic: the agent calls notify_user and the backend automatically applies the workflow Slack webhook plus enabled account-level notification channels. Slack is rich Block Kit by default; for structured summaries set slack_title, factual slack_color, slack_fields, slack_sections, and slack_footer on that same call. Never access a SECRET_* webhook variable, post with curl, or disable automatic Slack delivery to avoid a duplicate. Do not add a routing step merely to choose a notification channel.
- Ask separately what the workflow run summary should contain and what the Pulse review summary should contain, and whether they should use different channels or go to different people. Store only explicit, durable user-approved preferences with update_workflow_config(run_notification_instructions="...", pulse_notification_instructions="...", run_notification_channels=[...], pulse_notification_channels=[...]). workflow.json notifications.run_summary_instructions, notifications.pulse_summary_instructions, notifications.run_summary_channels, and notifications.pulse_summary_channels are authoritative; never put notification preferences in soul/soul.md. If the user says a preference applies to every notification, save it in both matching fields. Do not store temporary choices or credentials there.
- To configure a workflow Slack Incoming Webhook, use list_secrets first. If I provide a new URL, store it with set_workflow_secret(name="SLACK_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL", value=<url>), then call update_workflow_config(slack_webhook_secret_name="SLACK_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL"). The configuration tool validates the encrypted secret, makes it backend-only, and removes it from agent-visible secret injection. To disable workflow webhook delivery, call update_workflow_config(slack_webhook_secret_name="").
- SLACK CHANNELS: a Slack Incoming Webhook is tied to ONE channel when it is created and cannot be pointed at another, so "send this to a different channel" always means "use a different webhook". If I want the run summary and Pulse review in different channels, ask me for a webhook URL for EACH channel, store each under its own descriptive secret name with set_workflow_secret, then call update_workflow_config(run_notification_slack_webhooks=["SECRET_NAME_A"], pulse_notification_slack_webhooks=["SECRET_NAME_B"]). List several names to post one summary to several channels. Pass an empty array to fall back to the single workflow webhook. Never ask me to "pick a channel name" as if one webhook could reach several — tell me plainly that each channel needs its own webhook URL.
- Gmail is an inherited account-level notification channel. If I name who should receive this workflow's email, SAVE it — do not just use it for one send. Store it with update_workflow_config(run_notification_recipients=[...], pulse_notification_recipients=[...]); those persist to workflow.json notifications.run_summary_recipients / pulse_summary_recipients and the backend addresses every matching send from them automatically. Ask whether the run outcome and the Pulse review should go to the same people, since they are separate lists. Recipient lists say where mail GOES; they never unblock a blocked address, so if I name an address that is on a denylist, tell me rather than silently saving a list that will be skipped. Pass an empty array to clear a list back to the account default. Use the one-off email_to argument only for a single send I asked for explicitly.
- If I asked to test delivery, call notify_user once with a clearly labeled test message and report its returned delivered/skipped/failed channels honestly. Do not send a test unless I requested one.
- human_feedback is separate: use it only for short-lived input that must block this run, such as OTP, CAPTCHA, or immediate approval.`
