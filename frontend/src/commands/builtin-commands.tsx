- If publish is NOT configured: set it up — ask me which static host (Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages / Cloudflare R2 / S3 / any). As soon as I pick one, AUTO-CHECK its CLI (command -v) and INSTALL it for me if missing (announce it, e.g. "Installing the Vercel CLI…", then run npm i -g <cli>); do NOT ask me for an access token/API key — the path is install CLI → I run <cli> login once → you deploy.

Then write workflow.json.publish and publish/status.json with state "configured_not_verified". Do not publish yet.
- If publish IS configured: publish now. Publish BOTH artifacts — bake the report dashboard to static HTML AND publish the Pulse log (builder/improve.html); deploy dashboard.html + pulse.html + the nav index.html wrapper per the reference doc. If publish.targets only lists one, update it to include both first. Force every page to **DARK only** (matching the app) — set BOTH class="dark" and data-theme="dark" on the html element per the reference doc; no toggle, do NOT use prefers-color-scheme. Stage the files in a /tmp dir; if visibility is private, encrypt them with StatiCrypt ($SECRET_PUBLISH_PASSWORD) and apply the Runloop dark password-gate styling before deploying; run the deploy CLI from /tmp. Then give me the URL and confirm visibility + what's public.
CRITICAL — after deploying, come BACK to the workflow folder and persist state there (never in the /tmp staging dir): set workflow.json.publish.enabled=true with the destination + top-level url, AND write publish/status.json with state "published", the url, and last_source_hash (= the current_source_hash the backend reports; leave empty if unknown). A deploy that doesn't write these shows a grey "not configured" dot even though the site is live.

- Notifications are agentic: Chief of Staff decides when a non-blocking FYI, alert, progress update, or completion notice is useful and chooses the content. Delivery is deterministic: call notify_user and let the backend apply the configured Chief of Staff Slack webhook plus enabled account-level notification channels. Slack is rich Block Kit by default; for structured summaries set slack_title, factual slack_color, slack_fields, slack_sections, and slack_footer on that same call. Never access or post to a webhook URL directly. The same setting applies to interactive Chief chats and scheduled Chief/Org Pulse runs.
- Ask what events should notify and what a useful message should contain. Treat those as agent guidance, not routing. If I explicitly want the preference remembered, confirm it and use the existing Chief of Staff memory mechanism; never put preferences or credentials in the capabilities JSON.
- To configure Slack, call list_secrets first.

- If I ask to test delivery, call notify_user once with a clearly labeled test message and report its delivered/skipped/failed channels honestly. Do not test unless requested.

Delivery is deterministic: the agent calls notify_user and the backend automatically applies the workflow Slack webhook plus enabled account-level notification channels. Slack is rich Block Kit by default; for structured summaries set slack_title, factual slack_color, slack_fields, slack_sections, and slack_footer on that same call. Never access a SECRET_* webhook variable, post with curl, or disable automatic Slack delivery to avoid a duplicate. Do not add a routing step merely to choose a notification channel.
- Ask separately what the workflow run summary should contain and what the Pulse review summary should contain, and whether they should use different channels or go to different people. Store only explicit, durable user-approved preferences with update_workflow_config(run_notification_instructions="...", pulse_notification_instructions="...", run_notification_channels=[...], pulse_notification_channels=[...]). workflow.json notifications.run_summary_instructions, notifications.pulse_summary_instructions, notifications.run_summary_channels, and notifications.pulse_summary_channels are authoritative; never put notification preferences in soul/soul.md. If the user says a preference applies to every notification, save it in both matching fields. Do not store temporary choices or credentials there.
- To configure a workflow Slack Incoming Webhook, use list_secrets first. If I provide a new URL, store it with set_workflow_secret(name="SLACK_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL", value=<url>), then call update_workflow_config(slack_webhook_secret_name="SLACK_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL"). The configuration tool validates the encrypted secret, makes it backend-only, and removes it from agent-visible secret injection. To disable workflow webhook delivery, call update_workflow_config(slack_webhook_secret_name="").
- SLACK CHANNELS: a Slack Incoming Webhook is tied to ONE channel when it is created and cannot be pointed at another, so "send this to a different channel" always means "use a different webhook". If I want the run summary and Pulse review in different channels, ask me for a webhook URL for EACH channel, store each under its own descriptive secret name with set_workflow_secret, then call update_workflow_config(run_notification_slack_webhooks=["SECRET_NAME_A"], pulse_notification_slack_webhooks=["SECRET_NAME_B"]). List several names to post one summary to several channels. Pass an empty array to fall back to the single workflow webhook. Never ask me to "pick a channel name" as if one webhook could reach several — tell me plainly that each channel needs its own webhook URL.
- Gmail is an inherited account-level notification channel. If I name who should receive this workflow's email, SAVE it — do not just use it for one send. Store it with update_workflow_config(run_notification_recipients=[...], pulse_notification_recipients=[...]); those persist to workflow.json notifications.run_summary_recipients / pulse_summary_recipients and the backend addresses every matching send from them automatically. Ask whether the run outcome and the Pulse review should go to the same people, since they are separate lists. Recipient lists say where mail GOES; they never unblock a blocked address, so if I name an address that is on a denylist, tell me rather than silently saving a list that will be skipped. Pass an empty array to clear a list back to the account default. Use the one-off email_to argument only for a single send I asked for explicitly.
- If I asked to test delivery, call notify_user once with a clearly labeled test message and report its returned delivered/skipped/failed channels honestly. Do not send a test unless I requested one.

Read pulse/goals.html if it exists.
Review existing workflows and employees, then classify workflows as aligned, supporting/maintenance, or unaligned.

If goals are missing or vague, ask me only the missing questions needed to make them measurable:
- outcome
- horizon
- KPI targets with quantity: metric name, baseline/current value, target value, unit, direction, and target date
- source of truth for each target: workflow report, db table, external system, or manual update
- accountable owner/person
- contributing workflows or employees
- review cadence

Do not create vague goals. Each goal should look like a company operating target. Prefer numeric targets; if a goal is qualitative, convert it into dated milestone/checklist acceptance criteria. Do not invent quantities I did not give you — ask for them or mark the goal as needing a target.

If I gave enough detail${focus ? ' in the request above' : ''}, create or update pulse/goals.html now as a self-contained HTML scorecard. Keep prior goal history unless I explicitly ask to remove it.

After goals are saved, ask whether I want to turn on Daily Org Pulse. If I confirm, enable the built-in Org Pulse schedule (builtin-org-pulse). Do not silently enable it without confirmation.

Also ask whether I want to set up org-level backup and publish:
- backup records config + status in pulse/backup.json and pulse/backup/status.json

First call list_multiagent_schedules and find the existing Org Pulse schedule — the built-in builtin-org-pulse AND any other schedule that is really an Org Pulse (its name/description/query mentions "Org Pulse"). Report whether it is enabled, its cron, timezone, and last/next run state.
To enable or configure Daily Org Pulse, ALWAYS call update_multiagent_schedule on builtin-org-pulse (this owns/materializes the built-in). NEVER call create_multiagent_schedule for Org Pulse — a freshly-minted UUID schedule becomes a duplicate that the Org Pulse pill and the scheduler can disagree about. If a duplicate non-builtin Org Pulse schedule already exists, consolidate: enable builtin-org-pulse and disable (or delete) the duplicate so exactly one Org Pulse schedule remains.
Before editing any multi-agent schedule file directly, call read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/schedule-management.md"}]).

If pulse/goals.html is missing or has no measurable goals, explain that Daily Org Pulse can only measure org progress after goals exist. Ask whether I want to run /org-setup first or enable a workflow-health-only pulse temporarily. Do not create goals from this command unless I explicitly ask.

If goals exist, help me choose or confirm:
- enabled or disabled
- cadence and timezone
- whether it should notify only on decision-worthy changes
- whether the current pulse/org-pulse.html needs to be bootstrapped with the org-html skeleton
- whether org backup should be enabled before Daily Org Pulse writes goals/pulse/tasks
- whether org publish should share pulse/goals.html + pulse/org-pulse.html after verified runs

If org backup IS configured: run a backup now, skip only if pulse/backup/status.json proves the current source hash is unchanged, and report the result.

Always write pulse/backup/status.json. Never write org backup state into any workflow.json or content HTML file, and never back up secrets.`

If org publish is NOT configured: ask me which static host to use, default to private visibility with a PUBLISH_PASSWORD secret, write pulse/publish.json, and write pulse/publish/status.json with state "configured_not_verified". Do not do the first/verifying publish until I confirm the destination and visibility.

If org publish IS configured and verified: publish now only if the org HTML changed since the last publish. Stage files outside the workspace, force dark mode, deploy, then come back and update pulse/publish/status.json with state "published", the url, and last_source_hash.

Always write pulse/publish/status.json. Never publish secrets or raw task transcripts. Never write org publish state into any workflow.json or content HTML file.`

      const instruction = `Turn our current conversation into a new reusable workflow by calling the \`create_workflow\` tool with a valid workflow.json and plan.json.

## Step 1 — Pick a folder_name AND a display label
Workflows have two separate names:
- **folder_name** (the on-disk path under \`Workflow/\`) — must be **shell-safe kebab-case**: lowercase letters/digits with hyphens between words, no spaces, no underscores, no uppercase, no special characters (e.g. "customer-onboarding", "sales-report", "api-health-check"). 2-5 words, ≤64 chars.
- **label** (the human-readable display name that goes in \`workflow_json.label\`) — can be any string: spaces, capitalization, punctuation, whatever reads naturally (e.g. "Customer Onboarding", "AWS Cost Analysis Q3", "Müller's Pipeline").

If I gave you a label in my preamble, keep it verbatim as the \`label\` and slugify it for the \`folder_name\`. If I gave you a kebab-case name, use it for \`folder_name\` and also as the starting point for \`label\` (titlecased). Otherwise infer both from what we've been working on. If you cannot produce a clean folder_name, ask me one clarifying question instead of proceeding.

## Step 2 — Pick the capabilities from context
Analyze this conversation and select ONLY the MCP servers, skills, and LLM tier settings that are actually relevant to the workflow being extracted. **Do not blindly copy every currently-enabled server and skill — pick the ones the steps actually need.** If a server was enabled in chat but never used for this specific work, leave it out.

For secrets, default to no global secrets: set \`workflow_json.capabilities.selected_global_secret_names\` to \`[]\` unless this specific workflow clearly needs named global secrets. Do not use \`null\` as a default because it means all global secrets.

## Step 3 — Extract the steps
Re-read the conversation and extract the concrete, repeatable steps the workflow should run. Each step must have:
- A stable kebab-case \`id\` (e.g. "fetch-data", "analyze-results"), unique within the plan
- A human \`title\`
- A detailed \`description\` of what the step does, in enough detail that a worker with no memory of this conversation could execute it
- A \`success_criteria\` line describing how to tell the step succeeded
- Optionally \`context_dependencies\` (file names produced by earlier steps) and \`context_output\` (file name this step produces)
- Use \`"type": "regular"\` only for deterministic scripted work such as fixed API/CLI calls, parsing, normalization, and mechanical validation. Use \`"message_sequence"\` for every conversational, judgment-heavy, browser-driven, or adaptive step, even when it needs only one message. Non-scripted regular steps are unsupported. Use \`"routing"\` / \`"human_input"\` / \`"todo_task"\` only when the conversation genuinely calls for branching, human input, or sub-workflow orchestration.

## Step 4 — Call create_workflow
Build the two JSON objects yourself in this turn and call the privileged tool:

\`create_workflow(folder_name: "<kebab-name>", workflow_json: {..., label: "<human-readable>", ...}, plan_json: {...})\`

**IMPORTANT**: Use the \`create_workflow\` tool — do NOT try to \`mkdir\` or write files with shell commands. The \`Workflow/\` folder is read-only to normal shell writes; \`create_workflow\` is the only path that can create a new workflow folder. The tool validates folder_name (shell-safe kebab-case), enforces required JSON fields, refuses to overwrite existing workflows, and writes both files in one call.

The workflow.json schema (required: schema_version, id, label) and the plan.json schema (required: steps array with type/id/title) are already documented in your system prompt — follow that shape exactly.

## Step 5 — Report back to me
After the tool returns, tell me:
- The folder path returned by the tool
- The display label
- A one-line summary of what the workflow does
- The step IDs + titles (numbered list)
- Tell me I can pick it from the workflow picker to activate it.`

        ? `${ctx.beforeSlash}\n\n${instruction}`
