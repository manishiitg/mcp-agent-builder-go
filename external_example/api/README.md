## 🆕 **New Event Types Implemented** ✨

We've implemented **two new event types** to provide better ReAct reasoning tracking:

### **`react_reasoning_step`** - Intermediate Reasoning Steps
- **Purpose**: Captures each individual reasoning step during ReAct thinking
- **When**: Emitted for each "Thought:", "Action:", "Observation:" pattern
- **Data**: Step number, thought content, step type, and reasoning content
- **Example**: "I need to check AWS costs" → "Now I'll analyze the data"

### **`react_reasoning_final`** - Final Reasoning Step
- **Purpose**: Captures the final reasoning step before completion
- **When**: Emitted when "Final Answer:" pattern is detected
- **Data**: Final answer, complete content, and reasoning summary
- **Example**: "Based on my analysis, here are the recommendations..."

### **Benefits of New Events**
- **Better Tracking**: See exactly how the agent thinks through problems
- **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Understand the reasoning process in detail
- **Debugging**: Identify where reasoning might be going wrong
- **Performance**: Monitor how many steps each turn takes

  🔗 Reasoning Chain: Complete formatted reasoning chain with all steps
```

### **🔄 What Happens Between Turns in ReAct Agent** 🔄

#### **Turn 1 → Turn 2 Transition** 📈

**During Turn 1:**
1. **LLM generates reasoning** → `react_reasoning_step` events (multiple steps)
2. **Agent calls tools** → `tool_call_start` → `tool_call_end` events
3. **Agent processes tool results** → More reasoning
4. **Turn 1 completes** → `react_reasoning_final` → `react_reasoning_end` events

**Between Turns (LLM Reasoning):**
```
🎯 CAPTURED EVENT: llm_generation_start at 15:04:05.000
  🤖 Model: gpt-4o-mini

## ⏱️ **Event Timing and Flow** 🕐

### **Event Sequence in a Typical Turn**
```
1. react_reasoning_start     → Turn begins, reasoning starts
2. react_reasoning_step      → Step 1: Initial analysis
3. react_reasoning_step      → Step 2: Action planning
4. tool_call_start          → Tool execution begins
5. tool_call_end            → Tool execution completes
6. react_reasoning_step      → Step 3: Result analysis
7. react_reasoning_final     → Final reasoning step
8. react_reasoning_end       → Turn reasoning complete
9. conversation_turn         → Turn transitions
```

### **Event Timing Patterns**
- **Reasoning Events**: Emitted in real-time as LLM generates content
- **Tool Events**: Emitted when tools are actually called
- **LLM Events**: Emitted at start/end of each generation
- **Token Events**: Emitted after each LLM call completes
- **Turn Events**: Emitted when conversation state changes

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Event Frequency**: High-frequency events (reasoning steps) may impact performance
- **Event Size**: Large tool outputs trigger file saving events
- **Event Batching**: Events are processed in batches for efficiency
- **Memory Usage**: Event history is kept in memory during conversation

## 🚀 **How to Run**

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### **Build and Test**
```bash
# Build the application
go build -o event-test .

# Run the test
./test_events.sh

# Or run directly
./event-test
```

## 📊 **What It Tests**
1. **Agent Creation**: Tests if we can create an external agent
2. **Event Capture**: Captures all events during agent invocation
3. **Event Types**: Shows what events are actually emitted
4. **Timing**: Reveals if there are race conditions in event emission

## 🎯 **Expected Output**
```
🚀 Starting MCP Agent Event Capture Test

  Event 4: llm_generation_end at 15:04:05.000
  Event 5: conversation_end at 15:04:05.000
✅ Event capture test completed successfully
```

## 🔍 **What This Reveals**
- **Event Types**: Shows exactly what events the mcp-agent emits
- **Event Order**: Reveals the sequence of events
- **Event Timing**: Shows when each event occurs
- **Missing Events**: If events are missing, we'll see it here
- **Race Conditions**: If there are timing issues, they'll be visible

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Testing**
1. **Verify Event Capture**: Confirm all expected events are captured
2. **Check Event Types**: Ensure `

### **🔄 What Happens Between Turns in ReAct Agent** 🔄

#### **Turn 1 → Turn 2 Transition** 📈

**During Turn 1:**
1. **LLM generates reasoning** → `react_reasoning` events (multiple steps)
2. **Agent calls tools** → `tool_call_start` → `tool_call_end` events
3. **Agent processes tool results** → More reasoning
4. **Turn 1 completes** → `react_reasoning_end` event

**Between Turns (LLM Reasoning):**
```
🎯 CAPTURED EVENT: llm_generation_start at 15:04:05.000
