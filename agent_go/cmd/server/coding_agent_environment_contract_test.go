// The scoped coding-agent environment crosses three modules: AgentWorks mints
// the values, mcpagent copies them into the provider call, and
// multi-llm-provider-go overlays them onto the child process. Each layer used
// to decide independently which keys were legitimate, and the definitions
// drifted: AgentWorks created the MCP routes, the layer below admitted only
// SECRET_*, and the child never saw MCP_CUSTOM. Nothing errored. The feature
// simply did not work, which is indistinguishable from it not existing.
//
// llmtypes.IsScopedCodingAgentEnvironmentKey is now the single owner. These
// tests run from AgentWorks because AgentWorks is the layer that knows what it
// actually needs to pass; a test living beside the helper would only prove the
// helper agrees with itself.
//
// If you add a key to the policy, add a case here. The failure mode for an
// unlisted key is silence, so an untested key is an untested outage.
