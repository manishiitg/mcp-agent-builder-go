			Name:        "human_feedback",
			Description: "Request urgent, short-lived input that only a human can provide, such as an OTP/2FA code, CAPTCHA completion, explicit approval, a subjective decision, private information, or an explicit test of the human-feedback channel. This tool pauses only the calling agent turn until the human answers directly in the AgentWorks UI. It never sends through notify_user, Gmail, workflow webhooks, or account-level notification connectors. Do not use it for an ordinary Builder/chat question, something another agent can answer, or something that may wait hours or days. Choose the shortest realistic timeout_seconds; use an expiry shown by the external service when available. The tool returns the human's response as text. Bridge-only coding CLIs invoking the HTTP endpoint through execute_shell_command must keep curl in the foreground and wait for the same call to return; never use nohup, append &, delegate/background it, write the result to a temporary file, poll for completion, or ask the user to send another message after responding. Do not set the shell timeout shorter than timeout_seconds. Cursor CLI has an approximately 60-second silent MCP-call ceiling, so Cursor agents must set timeout_seconds to at most 45 seconds and may retry after an explicit expiry only when the input is still required.",

For workflow, Pulse, Goal Advisor, and other structured summaries, always set the channel-neutral summary_title, summary_status, summary_fields, and summary_sections, plus summary_routes for route-specific actions and review outcomes (major routing choices are sub-workflows; branch choices are not). Keep one digest per existing notification kind, shared work at the top level, and distinct route statuses; do not infer Pulse coverage from the schedule. summary_status must plainly describe what the workflow is doing now; explain why in the title, message, facts, or sections. Channel-specific rich fields may improve presentation but must not contain facts omitted from the neutral summary. If the workflow has a Slack Incoming Webhook configured, the backend sends a backend-owned rich Block Kit card there instead of using the global Slack connector. Excluding slack suppresses both delivery paths. Never access a SECRET_* webhook variable, construct a webhook payload in shell, post with curl, disable notify_user to avoid duplication, or ask for the URL after an encrypted webhook reference is configured—the backend exclusively owns delivery. If you need the human to answer before continuing, use human_feedback instead.
