// NotificationDestination tells a connector where to send a feedback request.
// Each connector field is optional — when set, the connector uses it; when nil,
// the connector falls back to a per-user preference (looked up via UserID),
// then to its workspace-wide default.
//
// A nil *NotificationDestination is equivalent to "no hints, do whatever your
// configured default is" and preserves the pre-routing behavior.

	// suppresses an inherited account-level channel without touching the
	// account-wide configuration. Matched case-insensitively.

	// can only block more, never unblock a globally-blocked address.

// WhatsAppDest is the WhatsApp-specific destination hint. ChannelID is a
// WhatsApp JID (e.g. "919000000000@s.whatsapp.net" or a group JID) used when
// replying to an active bot chat. PhoneE164 is the recipient phone number in
// E.164 format (e.g. "+919000000000").
