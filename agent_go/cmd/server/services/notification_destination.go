// NotificationDestination tells a connector where to send a feedback request.

// the connector falls back to a per-user preference (looked up via UserID),
// then to its workspace-wide default.
//
// A nil *NotificationDestination is equivalent to "no hints, do whatever your
// configured default is" and preserves the pre-routing behavior.
