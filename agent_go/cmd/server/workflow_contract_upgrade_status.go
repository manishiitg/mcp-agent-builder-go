// The upgrade instructions are Go constants that only the scheduler delivers,
// so none of this was reachable by a human. A blocked workflow surfaced one
// line in its run history —
//
//	workflow upgrade preflight upgrade-current-artifact-contract did not stamp
//	required version "1.0.21" (found "1.0.20", failure 2/3 consecutive)
//
// — which names a version and nothing else. Not what the migration asks for,
// not which rungs remain behind it, not why the last attempt stopped.
// confida-login sat blocked for days and diagnosing it meant reading server
// logs and session transcripts by hand.
//
// The instruction text is included in full and deliberately. It is what the
// scheduler sends; an owner deciding whether a stalled migration is safe needs
// to read the actual words, not a summary of them.
