// drainSyntheticTurnStream consumes a synthetic turn's text channel, applying
// onChunk for each chunk. It reports why the turn stopped producing — an empty
// reason when the stream closed normally — and whether it stopped because the
// producer went silent rather than because the turn was cancelled.
//
// The two are distinguished because they mean opposite things to a reader of
// the run history. A cancelled turn is a turn somebody stopped; a stalled one
// is a defect or a capacity wall. Collapsing both into "context canceled" is
// how a stuck turn gets filed as a user action and never investigated.
//
// PLAT-101. This replaces a bare `for range textChan`, which had exactly one
// exit: the producer closing the channel. When a coding-agent CLI parks on a
// usage-limit wall it stops producing without ever closing, and the loop's
// context was derived from context.Background(), so nothing could interrupt
// it. The consuming goroutine blocked forever, and with it the deferred
// cleanup that clears session-busy, releases the input lane, and records the
// tracked execution — leaving a session that reports "running" indefinitely
// with nothing executing behind it. Cancelling the session did not help
// either: cancellation reaches the producer, but the loop was waiting on the
// channel, not on the context.
//
// Both bounds are needed. The context covers a deliberate stop; the idle timer
// covers a producer that has silently stopped without erroring, which is the
// case a stalled tmux pane actually presents. Every rate-limit behaviour built
// on top of this — typed quota errors, suspend-and-resume — is unreachable
// while a turn can hang here instead of returning.
