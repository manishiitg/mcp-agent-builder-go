// Package guidance owns the canonical guided-flow text for every workflow
// slash command in the workshop UI. The text lives as embedded markdown
// templates so it can be rendered with focus/iteration/run_folder params and
// returned to the agent — the agent then follows the rendered prose verbatim.
// Focus is the conversation-derived instruction or context that caused the
// command, not just a narrow keyword. Slash-command wrappers should pass the
// user's surrounding/preceding request into focus when available.
//
// The same prose is reachable from three contexts:
//
//  1. A user typed a slash command. The slash command's frontend onSubmit
//     collapses to one line: "Call get_workflow_command_guidance(kind=<name>,
//     ...) and follow the returned instructions."
//  2. A user described the same intent in chat ("help me improve this
//     workflow"). The agent recognizes the intent and calls the tool.
//  3. A scheduled Pulse module (e.g. Goal Advisor selected by Pulse Gate) calls
//     the tool to get the same canonical flow.
//
// One source of truth, three callers.

For file tools that expect workspace paths, use workflow-root-qualified paths. If the current workflow path is ` + "`Workflow/<name>`" + `, read ` + "`Workflow/<name>/runs/...`" + `, ` + "`Workflow/<name>/evaluation/...`" + `, ` + "`Workflow/<name>/planning/...`" + `, and ` + "`Workflow/<name>/db/...`" + ` rather than bare ` + "`runs/...`" + `, ` + "`evaluation/...`" + `, ` + "`planning/...`" + `, or ` + "`db/...`" + `. Bare examples in this guidance are shorthand for paths under the current workflow root. Do not use host paths outside workspace-docs.

- ` + "`read_skill(skills=[{\"name\":\"builder-reference\",\"path\":\"references/<kind>.md\"}])`" + ` — load system reference docs before deep actions (for example ` + "`pulse-gate`" + ` for Pulse Gate, ` + "`pulse-review-fixer`" + ` for review/fix work, ` + "`code-authoring`" + ` before authoring ` + "`main.py`" + `, or ` + "`llm-selection`" + ` before changing workflow models). This intrinsic mcpagent tool works on API and coding-CLI transports; native CLI skill files are the same bundle.
- ` + "`get_workflow_command_guidance(kind, focus?)`" + ` — canonical procedural flows (design-plan, improve-evaluation, goal-advisor, define-success, etc.). The returned text is your instructions for that turn; follow it verbatim.
## Configuration access

` + configAccess + `

### Reference doc kinds available in this mode

` + kindList + `
## MCP bridge — only in code-execution mode

When you are running scripts via ` + "`execute_shell_command`" + ` (code-execution mode), call MCP tools through HTTP:

` + "```bash" + `
payload='{"arg":"value"}'
curl --fail-with-body -sS --json "$payload" -H "$MCP_AUTH" "$MCP_MCP/{server_name}/{tool_name}"
` + "```" + `

` + "`$MCP_AUTH`" + ` is already the complete ` + "`Authorization: Bearer ...`" + ` header. Never prepend another header or Bearer prefix. ` + "`--json`" + ` already selects POST and Content-Type, so do not add ` + "`-X POST`" + `, another Content-Type header, or ` + "`--data`" + `. Keep the call unpiped so curl's nonzero HTTP-failure status reaches ` + "`execute_shell_command`" + `.

Use ` + "`$MCP_MCP`" + ` only for real MCP servers from the workflow's selected server list. Built-in/custom categories such as ` + "`human_tools`" + `, ` + "`workflow`" + `, ` + "`workspace_advanced`" + `, ` + "`auto_improvement`" + `, and ` + "`knowledgebase_tools`" + ` are not MCP servers; call them as ` + "`$MCP_CUSTOM/{tool_name}`" + ` with no category segment. Example: ` + "`$MCP_CUSTOM/notify_user`" + `, never ` + "`$MCP_MCP/human_tools/notify_user`" + `.

Pre-set environment for scripts:
- ` + "`$MCP_MCP`" + `, ` + "`$MCP_CUSTOM`" + `, ` + "`$MCP_VIRTUAL`" + ` — short bridge endpoint bases
- ` + "`$MCP_AUTH`" + ` — Authorization header value for ` + "`curl -H`" + `
- ` + "`$MCP_API_URL`" + ` + ` + "`$MCP_API_TOKEN`" + ` — full endpoint + token fallback
- ` + "`$STEP_OUTPUT_DIR`" + `, ` + "`$STEP_EXECUTION_DIR`" + ` — write outputs here
- ` + "`$VAR_<NAME>`" + ` — workflow config (e.g. ` + "`$VAR_USER_ID`" + `); reference, never hardcode
- ` + "`$SECRET_<NAME>`" + ` — credentials; never echo to stdout, never write to files

In non-code-execution mode you call tools directly via the LLM tool-call API; the bridge curl pattern is not needed.

## When in doubt

Call the right discovery tool above before guessing. Hallucinated tool names or parameter shapes will fail at the bridge; reading the spec or the reference doc is cheap.
