// planning entry points must actually offer `branch` as an alternative to
// `routing` for a fixed choice, not just document `branch` in its own
// dedicated reference doc. The review found several of these docs still told
// the builder to use deterministic `routing` for every fixed branch choice,
// which silently defeats the whole point of PLAT-259's `branch` type (the
// small in-flow decision) -- new plans could keep producing `routing` steps
// for decisions `branch` was introduced to represent.
