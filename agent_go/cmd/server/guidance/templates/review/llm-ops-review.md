# STANDALONE LLM AND OPERATIONS REVIEW

Run the same low-frequency read-only LLM/Ops review used by Pulse. Do not change
models, tiers, fallbacks, schedules, notification recipients, backup, publish,
or credentials in this command.{{if .Focus}}

Focus especially on: {{.Focus}}.{{end}}{{if .RunFolder}}

Use `{{.RunFolder}}` as the primary run folder.{{end}}

1. Load `get_reference_doc(kind="post-run-monitor")`,
   `get_reference_doc(kind="llm-selection")`, and
   `get_reference_doc(kind="review-improve-log")`. These references belong to
   the parent. Do not pass HTML style, skeleton, CSS, migration, or card-format
   work to the reviewer.
2. Inspect resolved workflow/step/eval LLM configuration, actual model/tier use,
   fallbacks, matching cost and timing evidence, missing/unpriced buckets,
   retained `efficiency_or_coaching` findings, workflow version, and current
   backup/publish/notify readiness. Also inspect the current trustworthy Goal
   verdict and material success-criterion evidence. Use actual retained evidence,
   not provider assumptions or generic best practices. Inventory exact model
   pins in explicit workflow roles and planning/evaluation step config. Call
   `list_provider_models` once per pinned provider and compare against its
   catalog and `default_tier_models`; never infer recency from model names.
   Provider-profile defaults update automatically and are not stale pins.
3. Launch exactly one generic reviewer with a prompt beginning
   `READ-ONLY REVIEW`. It must not edit files or config, create questions,
   publish, notify, run the workflow, call Pulse module-state tools, or launch
   another agent. It may read only matching LLM/Ops/open-finding regions of
   `builder/improve.html`; it must not format or write the page.
4. Require a compact result grouped by `cost saving`, `quality`, `reliability`,
   and `setup`. Every recommendation needs current state, exact suggestion,
   expected benefit, risk, and evidence. Separate missing telemetry from true
   optimization opportunities. If a material goal criterion is below target,
   forbid tier/model downgrades for outcome-bearing, reasoning, diagnostic,
   recovery, eval, and verification steps. A downgrade is eligible only for a
   deterministic non-bottleneck step with representative evidence proving
   quality-equivalent output and no downstream outcome loss; label it as an
   approval-required reversible trial. Missing evidence means keep the tier.
   For an unavailable/deprecated pin or a materially useful newer provider-owned
   default, recommend either clearing the pin to inherit its tier or one exact
   supported replacement. Label it user approval required and include current
   model, affected roles/steps, capability/cost/reasoning comparison, expected
   benefit, and risk. A newer model is not automatically better.
   Return a non-HTML packet with `module=llm_ops_review`, `verdict`, `next_check`,
   and ordered findings. Every finding includes a stable `finding_id`,
   `target_key`, severity, plain-language summary, exact evidence, bounded
   `recommended_fix`, verification, and `user_judgment_required` with reason.
5. Validate and deduplicate the result against `builder/improve.html`. As the
   parent, make one bounded update that refreshes one compact LLM & operations
   review area with
   `data-pulse-section="signals" data-module="llm_ops_review"` in that HTML. Do not
   apply recommendations or create approval cards in this read-only command.

Finish with a short executive summary followed by every evidence-backed
recommendation in severity order. Identify which exact changes require user
approval before `/pulse-fixer` can apply them. Do not truncate the result to a
Top 3.
