# Pulse Fixer engineering practices

Use this reference for every Pulse Fixer mutation pass. It defines how to turn
review findings into durable repairs. The lifecycle and proof rules remain in
`references/fix-verification.md`; this reference governs diagnosis and repair
quality.

## Capability contract

The Fixer is a full Workflow Builder writer. It receives the canonical Workshop
tool profile and the same workflow read/write paths, including plan and route
creation/deletion, step/config/evaluation/report/store mutation, schedule
management, skills, model configuration, execution/debugging, secrets, and
managed database writes. Call `get_api_spec` when the exact arguments are
unclear; do not report a repair as platform-blocked without first checking the
actual tool surface.

Capability is not product approval. Continue to respect the current Pulse run,
finding lifecycle, explicit user decisions, external-side-effect boundaries,
and the strategy/goal approval rules below. Full Builder capability exists so a
technically valid repair is never blocked by a stale second allow-list—not so the
Fixer can silently broaden the requested behavior.

## Core method

For each actionable finding:

1. **Reproduce or re-read the cited failure with targeted evidence.** Treat
   reviewer prose as a lead, not proof. Resolve the exact run, target, inputs,
   tool result, and consumer. Use `query_step`/`get_step_prompts` for a named
   plan step, projected managed-DB queries for rows, and path/field-scoped shell
   searches with an explicit output bound. Never recursively print an entire
   plan step, README, database JSON column, or conversation just to locate one
   contract field; a large result is injected into every later model turn.
2. **Separate symptom from root cause.** Group failures only when they share the
   same cause, compatible target changes, and one verification condition. Keep
   every finding link on the bundle.
3. **Map the contract boundary.** Identify the producer, authoritative contract,
   validators, durable stores, downstream consumers, evals, reports, learnings,
   and knowledge notes affected by the target.
4. **Choose the smallest complete repair.** Change every surface required for
   consistency, but do not broaden into strategy, policy, or unrelated cleanup.
5. **Preserve meaning and safety.** Never weaken a check, invent missing data,
   lower a threshold, change a destination, or reinterpret an operator decision
   merely to obtain a pass.
6. **Exercise the real consumer path.** Prefer the actual parser, validator,
   query, scheduler transition, or tool boundary over a look-alike check.
7. **Record the honest lifecycle result.** Use `fixed_verified` only for passed
   post-change proof. Use `changed_unverified` when a producing run or external
   event is still required.

## Bounded backlog progress contract

A Pulse pass is one complete, evidence-backed repair objective—not an attempt to
zero every unrelated backlog root in one context window. Every Fixer pass must
see the complete active backlog that existed when the pass began, select the
highest-value coherent objective agentically, finish its lifecycle honestly,
and leave an exact ordered queue for later passes. This is not an arbitrary
top-N issue cap: one objective may carry many issue IDs when they truly share a
root cause, compatible targets, and one verification condition.

1. **Freeze a starting manifest.** Call
   `get_pulse_state(view="backlog", detail="compact")` exactly once with no
   module filter and retain every exact visible `issue_id`. The backend resolves
   the internal fingerprint and current attempt; never copy those internals into
   a Pulse write. Use
   `query_workflow_db` to count and inspect status, owning module, step, age,
   recurrence, attempts, and next-check boundaries before choosing an order.
2. **Rank from compact lifecycle evidence.** Use status, owner, severity,
   recurrence, attempts, next-check boundaries, current Gate evidence, and
   answered decisions to distinguish actionable roots from waiting or external
   work. Request `detail="full"` only for the bounded `issue_ids` that could
   become this pass's objective; do not perform a forensic reread of every row
   merely to restate the backlog.
3. **Select and bundle semantically.** Choose the highest-value objective that
   can reach a truthful proof boundary in this pass. Group actionable items only by shared root cause,
   compatible targets, and one verification condition. One repair may carry
   many finding links, but no finding may disappear inside a bundle.
4. **Maintain an explicit remaining list.** Prepare a lifecycle disposition for
   every issue linked to the selected objective and remove only those exact IDs
   from the working queue. Preserve all other IDs, in priority order, in the
   run-scoped checkpoint. Untouched findings retain their existing lifecycle;
   do not generate no-op attempts or current-pass dispositions for them.
5. **Check waiting boundaries rather than re-mutating.** An existing waiting
   state is accounted for only after checking whether its named run, answer,
   version, or evidence has arrived. If it has arrived, verify or resume the
   repair. If it has not, preserve the waiting state without manufacturing a
   redundant fix attempt.
6. **Reconcile before completion.** Re-read
   `get_pulse_state(view="backlog", detail="compact")` only after a lifecycle
   mutation that could have changed the manifest, then compare it with the
   starting manifest, selected issue IDs, dispositions, and checkpointed
   remaining queue. Do not reload an unchanged backlog merely to filter or
   restate it. Every selected issue must have a current-pass disposition.
   Every unselected starting issue must still be durable or have an independently
   recorded transition; its prior unmet boundary need not be rewritten. Submit
   the selected per-module disposition sets through the existing
   `record_pulse_result` calls and record the terminal module receipts.

If a selected item is unaccounted for, continue the pass. If a tool, evidence,
approval, or runtime failure blocks the selected objective, record that exact
boundary and report it truthfully; do not jump to unrelated queue items to make
the pass look productive. A pass may complete while the durable backlog remains
non-empty. Findings first created while the frozen pass is running belong to the
next pass unless they are inseparable consequences of the selected repair.

## Evidence hierarchy

Resolve conflicts in this order:

1. Explicit user decisions, safety constraints, and `soul.md` goal meaning.
2. Current platform and tool contracts proven by the running implementation.
3. Current plan and step configuration at the canonical saved path.
4. Current durable store schema and real consumer behavior.
5. Current validation and evaluation contracts.
6. Examples, learnings, knowledge notes, and old run artifacts.

Lower-ranked evidence may reveal drift but does not override higher-ranked
evidence. An old successful artifact proves only the old boundary.

## Repair-bundle contract

Before editing, state one compact bundle:

- root cause;
- linked visible issue IDs;
- canonical target and producer;
- affected consumers;
- intended files;
- baseline evidence;
- one post-change verification condition.

Do not file or repair one issue per field, stack frame, retry, table row, or
downstream symptom when they come from one cause. Do not merge findings that
need different policy decisions or different proof.

## Schema and artifact contract repair

Apply this playbook when JSON, database rows, tool envelopes, or other produced
artifacts fail shape, type, required-field, enum, or consistency checks.

### Diagnose

1. Group every prevalidation error from one producing step into one root
   finding. Artifact paths, fields, run identity, and contract version are
   evidence under that step finding, never separate bugs.
2. Read one real failing artifact. Do not infer its shape from error strings.
3. Read the producer instructions or code and the exact validation schema.
4. Search every downstream consumer, eval, report query, learning example, and
   schema manifest for the affected file and fields.
5. Determine which case applies:
   - **producer stale:** consumers and validator agree; repair the producer;
   - **validator stale:** producer and consumers agree; repair the validator;
   - **contract split:** producer, validator, and consumers disagree; establish
     one canonical shape from higher-ranked evidence and update all dependents;
   - **missing semantics:** the required value cannot be derived; keep the step
     failed or explicitly unavailable rather than fabricating a default.

### Repair

- Prefer a deterministic serializer or shared output builder when the step can
  compute the fields mechanically.
- For agentic producers, make the output contract concise and unambiguous, give
  one canonical example, and require a mechanical self-check before first write.
- Update producer instructions/code, validation, consumer assumptions, evals,
  report queries, and active learning/schema references together when they are
  in the blast radius.
- Preserve unknown, unavailable, skipped, and empty as distinct semantic states.
- Do not add placeholder zeros, empty arrays, or success values merely because
  the schema requires a field.
- Do not remove required checks until real consumers prove the field obsolete.
- Avoid compatibility aliases unless a live consumer still requires them; if
  needed, name the owner and removal condition.

### Verify

1. Validate a representative post-change artifact with the real prevalidator.
2. Exercise at least one real downstream consumer or parser against it.
3. Check a negative fixture so the validator still rejects the original defect.
4. Confirm every linked file- and field-level check is covered by the step-level
   root repair.
5. If an agentic or externally producing step has not run after the mutation,
   record `changed_unverified` with the exact next run/artifact boundary.

Prevalidation is a guard, not the durable repair. A repair turn may correct one
artifact, but recurring drift requires aligning the saved producer and every
consumer contract.

## Database repair

- Read the declared schema and real table shape before querying or mutating.
- Distinguish schema defects, invalid rows, stale derived data, and inaccessible
  storage; they require different repairs.
- Preserve keys, provenance, and idempotency. Use a transaction for related
  mutations and verify through the canonical query tool or consumer.
- Never perform a speculative migration. When row meaning is ambiguous, retain
  the evidence and request the missing decision.

## Applying an Ops config recommendation

Use this whenever a finding asks you to change `execution_tier`,
`execution_llm`, or `declared_execution_mode`. These are cost decisions
`llm_ops_review` owns; it is read-only, so you are the writer.

1. **Never apply one without an owning Ops finding.** These fields are not
   yours to tune opportunistically. If no finding recommends the change, the
   change is not justified — file the finding first, or leave it alone.
2. **Carry the evidence into the config, not just the fix.** Each field requires
   a paired reason (`execution_tier_reason`, `execution_llm_reason`,
   `declared_execution_mode_reason`) and the tool rejects the change without it.
   Write it so a reviewer six weeks from now can judge the decision without
   re-deriving it: cite the finding id, the current state, and the measured
   evidence. `planning/step_config.json` is what the next reviewer actually
   reads; a rationale that stays only in the finding is lost to them.
3. **Cite the decision when there was one.** If the recommendation was labelled
   `user_judgment_required` or applied after approval, include the
   `human_input_id` in the reason. A reason pointing at a recorded human call is
   the strongest form available.
4. **Know what you are switching off.** Pinning `execution_tier` also disables
   adaptive tiering for that step — it will no longer promote high→medium after
   3 stable runs. Pinning `execution_llm` overrides tier entirely. Say so in the
   reason, so the next reviewer knows it was deliberate.
5. **If the evidence does not settle it, do not change it.** Raise the question
   with `create_human_input_request` and park the finding `awaiting_user`
   against that pending decision. Never invent a reason to satisfy the field —
   a fabricated justification is harder to challenge later than a missing one,
   and uncertainty is a legitimate terminal state.

## Learning and skill purity repair

Apply this playbook whenever a finding concerns `learnings/_global/`, a
`learning_objective`, or `learnings_access`.

1. **Inventory the complete skill package.** Read the root `SKILL.md` and every
   content-bearing Markdown file under `references/`. References are part of
   the skill, not an archive for content removed from the index.
2. **Classify before editing.** Keep only reusable execution HOW: procedures,
   selector strategy, auth/API/CLI/tool quirks, parsing/retry/recovery rules,
   stable failure signatures, and concise operational constraints needed to
   perform the task. Route everything else by meaning:
   - business/domain facts → knowledgebase;
   - run results/current values/status → DB or run evidence;
   - owner goals/preferences/thresholds → `soul.md`;
   - strategy/cadence/routing/current step behavior → plan/config;
   - incidents, provenance, action/run IDs, decisions, and fix history → durable
     Pulse review/finding/decision evidence;
   - platform architecture/schema history → authoritative documentation or DB
     contract, retaining only the short runner-facing instruction in the skill.
3. **Do not launder content through references.** Move detailed reusable HOW
   from `SKILL.md` to a focused reference. Remove non-skill content from the
   whole package; putting it in `references/` is not a repair.
4. **Preserve evidence before removal.** Cite the exact source block in the
   durable Pulse result. If an authoritative destination already contains the
   material, remove the duplicate. If a bounded authorized KB/config repair is
   safe, apply it through the canonical tool. Never invent a fact, rewrite
   user-owned context, mutate run data speculatively, or discard the only copy
   of an unresolved user decision.
5. **Repair contribution configuration.** For every effective
   `learnings_access="read-write"` step, require a concrete objective that asks
   only for reusable HOW. Clear a misplaced/legacy objective and set access to
   `read` when the step should consume but not contribute. Preserve
   `read-write` only when the objective and actual skill coverage agree.
5b. **Judge whether each objective is still yielding, and refine it.** An
   objective is an instruction, and instructions are expected to improve as
   evidence accumulates — treat them as tunable, not as set-once configuration.
   The evidence is already recorded per step in
   `learnings/<step-id>/.learning_metadata.json`: each reflection turn appends a
   `detection_history` entry with `has_new_learning`, plus
   `last_detection_reasoning` and `last_detection_confidence`. Read it and act:
   - **Repeated `has_new_learning: false`** — the objective is not yielding.
     Either sharpen it to name what this step uniquely observes, or drop the
     step to `learnings_access="read"`. A reflection turn that never produces
     anything is pure cost.
   - **Yields, but the content is misrouted** (facts, run results, or incident
     narrative reaching the skill) — the objective is asking for the wrong
     thing. Rewrite it to ask only for reusable HOW.
   - **Yields good technique** — leave it alone.

   Refining an objective needs **no** paired reason field and is not gated:
   these are meant to be iterated. Record the why in `review_notes`. Apply the
   same judgment to `knowledgebase_contribution`, whose yield signal is the KB
   self-review outcome rather than `detection_history`.
6. **Keep the root as an index.** `SKILL.md` contains valid frontmatter, a short
   scope, core cross-cutting instructions, and links to focused references.
   Detailed HOW belongs in references without duplication.

Verification is an immediate semantic re-read, not merely a successful patch:

- re-inventory and re-read every content-bearing Markdown file in the skill;
- confirm every remaining block is reusable execution HOW;
- confirm no incident/provenance, decision ledger, run result/current status,
  business fact, strategy, owner-value duplicate, or architecture history was
  retained or hidden in a reference;
- validate all index links and confirm references are reachable without
  duplicate homes;
- re-read every changed step config and confirm effective access/objective
  pairing;
- name separately routed work that could not be safely applied. Content cleanup
  may be `fixed_verified` when this complete post-change re-read passes; routed
  KB/DB/plan changes still follow their own proof boundary.

## Cross-store ownership repair

Apply this playbook to every Stores Health finding, including KB and DB purity:

1. **Reconcile before editing.** Merge the learning `purity_manifest`,
   `kb_purity_manifest`, and `db_ownership_manifest` into one
   `ownership_manifest`. Each item names its current location, semantic type,
   authoritative owner, duplicate locations, action, and verification. One
   semantic item has one authoritative owner: Soul=why/goals/preferences/hard
   constraints; Plan/step config=current behavior; Validation=deterministic
   proof; Learnings=reusable execution HOW; KB=durable domain facts with
   provenance; DB=structured operational state; Pulse=findings, diagnosis,
   attempts, decisions, and fix verification.
2. **Protect the only copy.** Preserve exact source evidence in Pulse before
   removing anything. Never rewrite user-owned `knowledgebase/context`, invent
   provenance, or move ambiguous row semantics. If the destination write is
   not authorized or meaning is unclear, keep the source and record the exact
   blocker or user decision instead of creating data loss.
3. **Move meaning, not formatting.** Put reusable HOW in a skill, durable facts
   with provenance in KB notes, and structured state in normalized DB records.
   Soul/Plan/Validation changes use their canonical workflow tools. Pulse keeps
   review history. Replace legitimate cross-store consumers with stable
   IDs/paths or queries, not copied prose/JSON snapshots.
4. **Remove duplicates only after destination proof.** Re-read the destination,
   prove provenance/keys and downstream consumers, then remove the old copy.
   Re-run all three manifests and confirm no contradictory owner remains. A
   patch success or smaller file is not verification.
5. **Lock only after cleanup.** Set `lock_learnings` or
   `lock_knowledgebase` only when the complete relevant manifest is clean and
   current-run evidence confirms stability. Decide learning locks per step from
   that step's effective objective, description hash, successful-run evidence,
   and `.learning_metadata.json`; shared `_global` content is insufficient.
   Unlock on drift. Treat `lock_code` as a separate, stricter executable proof.

Immediate semantic moves may be `fixed_verified` only when source removal,
destination exactness, references, and the current consumer are all re-checked.
Behavioral/configuration changes that need a producing run remain
`changed_unverified` with that exact run boundary.

## Tool, path, and permission repair

- Interpret nested bridge envelopes and semantic error markers, not only process
  exit codes.
- Confirm the actual tool surface and target type before declaring a capability
  missing.
- Resolve canonical absolute workspace and run paths; do not make a stale
  relative-path workaround permanent.
- Repair the harness when the same failure crosses workflows. Do not copy a
  platform workaround into every workflow.

## Scheduler and lifecycle repair

- Trace live execution state, child completion, durable run metadata, and UI
  projection separately.
- Define the state transition invariant before editing. A UI badge change is not
  a scheduler repair.
- Test ordering, retries, cancellation, recovery, and durable terminal state.

## Evaluation and report repair

- Missing evidence is unavailable, never a perfect score or zero by default.
- Preserve raw precision and provenance until presentation formatting.
- Verify that report and evaluation queries resolve the intended run, group,
  time window, and canonical store.
- Presentation-only changes cannot claim direct goal impact.

## Stop conditions

Stop and disposition honestly when:

- the change alters goal meaning, policy, money, recipients, credentials, or
  external side effects without exact approval;
- evidence cannot establish the canonical semantics;
- only a future producing run can prove behavior;
- the root cause is an externally owned platform or vendor defect;
- the proposed repair would merely silence detection.

Never describe these states as verified fixes.
