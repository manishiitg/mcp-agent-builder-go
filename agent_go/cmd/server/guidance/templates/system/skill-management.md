## Skill Management — install skills and attach them to workflows

Skills are reusable instruction sets (a `SKILL.md` plus optional bundled files) injected into step agents at runtime only when the step explicitly enables them. This doc covers the full lifecycle: find → install → select for workflow discovery → enable per step → remove. To *author* a new skill from scratch, use the `skill-creator` skill — do not hand-write `SKILL.md` content.

### Where skills live

Skills live at the **workspace root**, `<workspace-root>/skills/<folder>/SKILL.md`, and are **shared across all workflows**. Do NOT create or reference skills inside a workflow folder (e.g. `Workflow/trading/skills/` does not exist). Custom/authored skills live under `<workspace-root>/skills/custom/<folder>/`.

### Lifecycle

1. **Find**
   - `list_skills` — installed skills in this workspace.
   - `search_skills(query)` — search the public registry.
2. **Install**
   - `install_skill(source)` — from the registry, source format `owner/repo@skill-name`.
   - `import_skill(github_url)` — from a GitHub folder URL.
   - Both download into `<workspace-root>/skills/<folder>/`. If a folder exists but has no `SKILL.md`, reinstall it with the same method it was originally installed with — **never write `SKILL.md` by hand**.
3. **Select for workflow/builder context**
   - `update_workflow_config(add_skills=["folder-name"])`. This records the skill as a selected workflow capability for workshop/builder discovery. Do NOT edit `workflow.json` manually.
4. **Enable for specific runtime steps**
   - `update_step_config(step_id, enabled_skills=["skill-a"])` makes that step receive the listed skills at execution time.
   - Step execution does not inherit workflow-selected skills, so every runtime skill must be listed on the step that needs it.
5. **Remove from the workflow**
   - `update_workflow_config(remove_skills=["folder-name"])`.
6. **Uninstall**
   - `uninstall_skill(folder_name)` — deletes the files from the workspace entirely.

Inspect at any point with `get_workflow_config` (the workflow's selected skills) and `list_skills` (everything installed). Inspect `planning/step_config.json` or use step config tools to see per-step `enabled_skills`.

### Attachment model: selected vs enabled (important)

There is **no cascade** from workflow-selected skills to runtime step execution. A step's effective skills are resolved as:

- Step has `enabled_skills` set to one or more folder names → the step receives exactly those skills.
- Step has no `enabled_skills` → the step receives no installed skills.

So workflow selection is discovery/context for workshop agents, not runtime inheritance. To remove runtime skills from a step, use `update_step_config(step_id, clear_fields=["enabled_skills"])` or set the desired replacement list explicitly.

**Shared know-how that every step should see** does not belong in a skill attached to all steps — it belongs in `learnings/_global/SKILL.md`, which is auto-attached at every step launch. Use real installed skills for *reusable domain capabilities*; use `learnings/_global` for *this workflow's accumulated knowledge*.

### When to use workflow-level vs per-step

- **Workflow-level (`add_skills`)** — capability inventory for builder/workshop review and discovery. Use this to document that a workflow is expected to use a skill, but still enable it on runtime steps.
- **Per-step (`enabled_skills`)** — the actual runtime attachment. Each attached skill costs prompt tokens and dilutes the agent's focus, so scope narrowly to the steps that need the skill.

### Troubleshooting

- **Skill not taking effect on a step** → check that the step explicitly lists it in `enabled_skills`. `update_workflow_config(add_skills=[...])` alone is not enough for runtime execution.
- **Folder exists but no `SKILL.md`** → reinstall via the original method (`install_skill` / `import_skill`); do not author the file manually.
- **Too many skills / bloated step prompts** → remove unnecessary skills from each step's `enabled_skills`; keep workflow-level selection as a lightweight capability inventory only when useful.
- **Need to author or improve a skill** → use the `skill-creator` skill; for sub-agent templates use `subagent-creator`. Neither installs/attaches — that's this doc's tools.
