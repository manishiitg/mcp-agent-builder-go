## Pulse archive preflight

Use only for the scheduler's conditional `archive-improve-log` stage. This is a
semantic history compaction pass, not a normal Pulse review or a format rewrite.

`builder/improve.html` remains the lightweight published executive journal.
Preserve:

- the verdicts, status sentence, three-cell Latest Pulse brief, and freshness
  labels;
- every unresolved material decision transition still needed in the executive
  journal;
- the newest 6 material dated Activity cards or run rows, even when some are
  older than 15 calendar days;
- every item without a valid `data-date="YYYY-MM-DD"` (undated history is never
  archived automatically);
- the current Agent handoff and all evidence still needed by a later Pulse.

Move only resolved findings, superseded confirmed decisions, and routine run
rows into `builder/improve-archive/YYYY-MM.html` when they are either outside
the newest 6 material dated items or strictly older than 15 calendar days by
their `data-date`. Age or position alone never makes an open or pending item safe
to move. Each archive is a
complete renderable HTML document, never a fragment. Merge an existing month
without duplicates and keep entries newest first. Add or update one compact
Archive Index link (`href="improve-archive/YYYY-MM.html"`) in the active page
with the month, date range, and moved count.

Archive safely: read active and target archive files fully; stage complete
documents as temporary files under `builder/`; verify both are non-empty and
contain html/head/body;
verify every moved item appears exactly once across active plus archive and no
protected/open item moved; only then replace the archive and active files.
Never truncate the original first. If nothing is safely archivable, leave the active
file unchanged and report that plainly. Do not change workflow logic, verdicts,
plans, cadence, reports, or any non-Pulse artifact. Stop after this stage.
