## Workshop & Workflow Tools — Full Reference

The workshop chat agent has access to a broad set of workflow-management
tools. The inline system prompt now carries only a one-line-per-category
cheat sheet; this skill is the deep reference with full signatures,
parameters, when-to-use rules, and gotchas.

If you need to confirm an exact parameter shape that isn't documented here
and you are a coding CLI reaching tools through the api-bridge (code
execution / agentic mode — see the "Coding-CLI bridge routing" section
below), call `get_api_spec(tool_name="...")` — that returns the live JSON
schema for the tool. `get_api_spec` is registered only in that mode; a
native tool-calling session already receives every tool's full schema
declared directly to the model and must not call it — the runtime has
nothing to answer with, and the call fails as "not registered for session".

### Coding-CLI bridge routing

The function-style names in this catalog are logical workflow tool names;
they do not mean every tool is exposed natively by `api-bridge`. In a coding
CLI, the native bridge exposes only `execute_shell_command`,
`diff_patch_workspace_file`, `agent_browser`, and `get_api_spec`. Never try
`api-bridge.list_executions`, `api-bridge.query_step`, or another catalog name
as a native bridge call. For every non-native tool, call
`get_api_spec(tool_name="<name>")` first, then use
`execute_shell_command` to invoke the endpoint it returns with the supplied
`$MCP_MCP`/`$MCP_CUSTOM` route and `$MCP_AUTH`. Do not guess or hardcode an
HTTP URL.

## Step Execution & Inspection

- **`execute_step(step_id, group_name, instructions?, human_input?, tier?, message_sequence_restart?)`** — Start a single step in the background; returns `execution_id`. In Workshop mode this is the primary way to test one step after adding or editing it. Execution uses `iteration-0`. A standalone `message_sequence` always starts its configured queue from the beginning; `human_input` adds opening context, not durable resume. Only a message-sequence route inside an active todo-task run has in-memory re-entry. For `human_input` steps, `human_input` is used as the response. For other executable steps, `human_input` is high-priority custom context.
- **`execute_step(step_id, group_name, fast_path_only=true)`** *(Workshop mode only)* — Run the step's saved Python `learnings/{step-id}/main.py` directly with the same workflow env, args, output folder, and validation behavior as a real workflow run. Never falls back to LLM. Used to quickly test `scripted` main.py patches.
- **`query_step(step_id, tool_call_id?)`** — One-off live status check for a running single step. Resolves the latest execution for that step and shows execution status plus structured MCP tool calls and tool-call details captured so far. For coding-CLI providers, terminal/TUI progress does not appear as MCP tool calls — but when the step runs in tmux, query_step **inlines the latest lines of the live terminal pane** and also returns the tmux session name + a `tmux capture-pane -pt <session> -S -200` command for deeper history (same session as the UI terminal). Do **not** combine `sleep`, `list_executions`, and `query_step` into a polling loop. After launching background work, use at most one immediate status check, then yield; `[AUTO-NOTIFICATION]` will resume the conversation when the work completes.
- **`send_step_message(execution_id, message)`** — Send a correction or follow-up to the exact active child-agent turn inside a running step or full-workflow execution. Use the ID returned by `execute_step` / `run_full_workflow`; never guess from the step ID. Coding CLIs receive native live input, while non-coding agents queue the message for the next safe turn boundary. This does not start or resume work. `no_active_agent` means the execution is between agent turns or running validation/script work; wait instead of retrying in a loop.
- **`debug_step(step_id, iteration, group_name)`** — Rich insights: learning status, validation result, log paths.
- **`list_executions(status_filter?)`** — List all background executions. Use it to find an execution id or debug ambiguity, not as a repeated progress poll.
- **`stop_step(execution_id)` / `stop_all_executions()`** — Cancel running steps.
- **`run_in_background(name, instruction)`** — Spawn an independent background agent with the same tools.
- **`run_goal_advisor_review(pulse_run_id?, focus?)`** — Spawn the dedicated Goal Advisor background agent for a manual `/goal-advisor` or other non-scheduled workshop review. Scheduled Pulse does not call this tool; its independent Goal Advisor module stage runs the strategy reviewer and critic. The manual parent may capture the returned `execution_id`, optionally call `query_step(step_id="goal-advisor", execution_id="<returned execution_id>")` once for immediate status, then stop if it is still running and rely on `[AUTO-NOTIFICATION]` to resume result recording. Do not do the expensive strategy review inline in the parent turn.
- **`run_full_workflow(group_name, human_inputs?, route_selections?, disable_eval?)`** — Execute the complete workflow (all steps) for a single variable group in background. Always uses `iteration-0` and starts from the beginning. If the selected path has `human_input` steps, provide `human_inputs` (object mapping step_id to response string). For deterministic routers, pass `route_selections` keyed by routing step ID, with each value as a `route_id` or unique `next_step_id`. Pass `disable_eval=true` only when the user explicitly wants to skip the automatic evaluation pass. Returns `execution_id`. In scheduled/run-mode flows, call it once for the intended group, then stop instead of polling substeps; auto-notifications report progress/completion.

## Step Config & Analysis (Workshop mode)

- **`update_step_config(step_id, ...)`** — Update servers, tools, skills, learning settings, execution mode, LLMs, locks, review notes, description review state, and read-only `additional_read_paths` grants for declared workflow-relative inputs outside the standard run/db/KB/learnings surfaces. For eval steps this writes to `evaluation/step_config.json`.
- **Pulse reviews + Fixer** — Scheduled Pulse runs independent read-only module reviews, then one consolidated Fixer for the pass. The reviewers return evidence, recommendations, and structured verification results. The Fixer is the only writer: it groups compatible findings into durable repair bundles, applies them sequentially, and records every module result. Explicit `/pulse-fixer` uses the same single-writer path after `begin_pulse_fixer_run`, without Gate or new reviewers.
- **Objective + success criteria** — Edit `soul/soul.md` directly via shell (fill in the `## Objective` and `## Success Criteria` sections). `soul.md` is stable intent, not architecture: never add step design, provider/tool choices, implementation decisions, inferred assumptions, or a decision log. Optional constraints belong there only when the user explicitly approved them as durable boundaries. `plan.json` owns the current implementation attempt. No dedicated tool — use `diff_patch_workspace_file` or a shell heredoc.
- **Notification preferences** — Keep execution reporting separate from Pulse reporting. `update_workflow_config(run_notification_instructions="...")` controls the **Run outcome** section: outputs, failures, goal movement, and metrics from the workflow execution. `update_workflow_config(pulse_notification_instructions="...")` controls the **What Pulse did** section: reviews, fixes, recommendations, decisions, backup/publish state, and next actions. If the user explicitly says a preference applies to every notification, save it in both fields. `workflow.json` `capabilities.notifications.run_summary_instructions` and `pulse_summary_instructions` are authoritative and supplied to Workflow Builder and Pulse finalization. Never put notification preferences in `soul/soul.md`; that file owns goal and user-approved outcome constraints, not presentation or delivery behavior. Missing preferences use Pulse defaults.
- **Goal Advisor proposals and experiments** — Material strategy/path changes use the existing report interaction flow, not a separate plan-change workflow. Scheduled Pulse obtains a read-only strategy review plus an independent critic in its Goal Advisor module stage; manual `/goal-advisor` may use the dedicated background advisor. Both are strategy-first: they must state the current strategy ceiling and one materially different highest-leverage thesis before plan mechanics. They maintain at most one active **strategy** `.advisor-experiment` in `builder/improve.html` using `data-experiment-kind="strategy"`, preserving the baseline, metric, guardrails, checkpoint, and rollback condition through proposal, approval, running, measurement, and terminal outcome. Instrumentation-only tracking is a Pulse module handoff, not an Advisor experiment and does not block strategy review. Goal Advisor may create or refresh `create_human_input_request(source="goal_advisor", input_id="plan-proposal-...", options=[approve,reject,defer], context="<proposal + exact intended edits + rationale + expected impact + risk + evidence>")`. A later Pulse run may apply an approved proposal with normal plan modification/config/eval/report tools, call `mark_human_input_consumed`, and advance the same experiment card. In active manual Workshop chat, apply a bounded evidence-backed plan change directly only when the user is asking for improvement and the evidence is strong.
- **`review_workflow_timing(iteration?, group_name?, focus?)`** — Read-only latency review: finds the slowest groups/steps/tools/LLM calls and recommends faster descriptions, fewer handoffs, safer step merges, or plan changes.
- **`review_workflow_costs(iteration?, group_name?, focus?)`** — Read-only cost review: finds the biggest cost drivers and recommends cheaper models, fewer retries/handoffs, better descriptions, or plan changes without sacrificing success criteria.
- **`get_cost_summary(run_folder?)`** — Token usage and cost breakdown.

## Read-Only Info

- **`get_step_prompts(step_id, attempt?, iteration?)`** — System prompt and user message for a step.
- **`get_workflow_config`** — Inspect the workflow's current MCP servers, selected skills, available secrets, notification content instructions and one-way destinations, LLM config, and schedules. Use this instead of `cat workflow.json` when you need the full workflow config. For the global installed skill catalog, use `list_skills`.
- **`get_llm_config`** — Per-step LLM overrides.
- **`get_workflow_command_guidance(kind="review-artifact-drift", focus?)`** *(Workshop only)* — Canonical read-only artifact drift audit after material plan/config changes. In Pulse it is separate from Bug Review; the parent Pulse Fixer applies verified repairs and marks reviewed changelog entries.

## Plan Modification (Workshop mode)

- **Create steps**: `create_plan`, `add_scripted_step`, `add_message_sequence_step`, `add_human_input_step`, `add_todo_task_step`, `add_routing_step`, `delete_plan_steps`, `cleanup_orphan_step_configs`.
- **Update steps**: `update_scripted_step`, `update_message_sequence_step`, `update_human_input_step`, `update_routing_step`, `update_todo_task_step`. For a saved legacy `regular` step whose `declared_execution_mode` is absent or non-scripted, call `update_message_sequence_step`; the harness atomically upgrades it to its effective `message_sequence` runtime type while applying the edit. Never use `update_scripted_step` for that compatibility case.
- **Todo task routes**: `add_todo_task_route`, `update_todo_task_route`, `delete_todo_task_route`. For todo_task routes, choose one pattern per route: inline `sub_agent_step` for a route-specific agent, or `orphan_step_ref` to reuse a shared orphan step already allowlisted via `shared_with.orchestrator_ids`. Do not set both.
- **Validation**: `update_validation_schema`.
- **Graph integrity is atomic**: every plan mutation validates all routing routes, todo/message-sequence `next_step_id` fields, and human-input branches before saving. `PLAN_GRAPH_INVALID` means nothing was saved. Repair every reference listed in the error with the appropriate `update_*_step` tool (target an existing step ID or `end`), then retry the original mutation. In particular, reroute inbound references before deleting their target step.

## Variables & Config

- **`update_variable(action, name?, value?, description?)`** — Add, update, or delete a variable.
- **`add_group` / `update_group` / `delete_group`** — Manage variable groups.
- **MCP servers workflow**:
  1. `get_workflow_config` to inspect which servers are currently selected.
  2. `update_workflow_config(add_servers=["server-name"])` selects an **already-registered** server into the workflow. **Do NOT edit `workflow.json` manually.**
     - To **register a new server first** (so it can be selected), use `add_mcp_server(name, protocol="stdio"|"sse"|"http", ...)`: for a stdio server give `command` + `args` (+ optional `env`, `working_dir`) — e.g. an npx-launched server is `command="npx", args=["-y","<package>"]`; for SSE/HTTP give `url`. It registers a user-defined server and triggers discovery; then select it with `add_servers`.
  3. Optional workflow-level allowlist: `update_workflow_config(add_tools=["server:*"])` or `add_tools=["server:tool_name"]`. Tool entries must reference selected workflow servers.
  4. `update_step_config(step_id, servers=["server-name"], tools=["server:tool_name"])` to scope specific servers/tools to a step.
- **Browser workflow**:
  1. Pick the workflow mode with `update_workflow_config(browser_mode="none"|"auto"|"headless"|"cdp")`. Prefer `auto` unless the workflow must require an authenticated visible Chrome (`cdp`) or must stay isolated in the background (`headless`). For the specialized case where one workflow needs independent login identities, set `cdp_ports=[9222,9333]` (maximum four) and launch each port with a distinct Chrome `--user-data-dir`; ordinary workflow concurrency uses one shared CDP browser.
  2. For `agent_browser` steps, enable `workspace_browser:agent_browser` via `update_step_config(enabled_custom_tools=[...])` and attach the matching runtime skill with `enabled_skills=["agent-browser"]`.
  3. For browser steps, attach `enabled_skills=["agent-browser"]`; the runtime provides the managed `agent_browser` tool.
- **Slack Incoming Webhook notifications** (one-way, per workflow):
  1. Store the full URL with `set_workflow_secret(name="SLACK_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL", value="https://hooks.slack.com/services/...")`. This encrypts and auto-attaches it; never write the URL into `workflow.json`.
  2. Configure the safe reference with `update_workflow_config(slack_webhook_secret_name="SLACK_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL")`.
  3. `update_workflow_config` converts that secret into a backend-only notification credential and removes it from agent-visible `selected_secrets` / `SECRET_*` injection. Current and future `notify_user` calls automatically send a rich Block Kit card to the webhook in addition to enabled account-level channels. Use `slack_title`, `slack_color`, `slack_fields`, `slack_sections`, and `slack_footer` for structured summaries; even a plain call gets the safe rich default. `human_feedback` never uses it because Incoming Webhooks cannot return an answer. Pass `slack_webhook_secret_name=""` to disable it without deleting the stored secret.
  4. Never read a webhook through `$SECRET_*`, post with `curl`, put a webhook recipe into a plan step, or disable automatic Slack delivery to avoid a duplicate. The backend owns the URL, Block Kit validation, fan-out, and delivery status; the agent calls `notify_user` exactly once.
  5. This is independent of the interactive Slack bot (Socket Mode, @mentions, threads, and replies).
- **`update_workflow_config(add_servers?, remove_servers?, add_tools?, remove_tools?, add_skills?, remove_skills?, add_secrets?, remove_secrets?, run_notification_instructions?, pulse_notification_instructions?, slack_webhook_secret_name?, browser_mode?, cdp_ports?, run_retention_count?)`** — Update workflow MCP servers, workflow-level MCP tool allowlist, skills, secrets, scoped notification content preferences, one-way Slack webhook reference, browser mode/profile ports, or run/eval backup retention.

## Schedule Management (Workshop mode)

For the operational cheat sheet on creating / editing / deleting schedules
(cron syntax and workshop run payload shape), see this section. For the
multi-agent-only schedule cron flow, see
`read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/schedule-management.md"}])` instead.

- **Tools**: `list_schedules`, `create_schedule`, `create_calendar_schedule`, `update_schedule`, `delete_schedule`, `trigger_schedule`, `get_schedule_runs`.
- To view existing schedules, call `list_schedules`; it includes schedule IDs, type, mode, workshop mode, cron/calendar shape, timezone, enabled state, groups, and recent runtime state. `get_workflow_config` also includes a Schedules section when you are already inspecting broader workflow settings.
- **Entry shape**:
  ```
  { "id": "...", "name": "...", "description": "...",
    "cron_expression": "0 9 * * 1-5", "timezone": "UTC",
    "enabled": true, "trigger_payload": {},
    "group_names": ["confida-prod"],
    "mode": "workshop", "workshop_mode": "run" }
  ```
  Fields: `id` (auto-assigned), `name` (display label), `description` (optional), `cron_expression` (standard 5-field cron), `timezone` (IANA tz e.g. `America/New_York`), `enabled` (bool), `trigger_payload` (arbitrary JSON passed to the run), `group_names` (required array of one or more explicit group names from `variables/variables.json`), `mode` (`workshop` for workflow schedules), `workshop_mode` (`run` for normal recurring workflow runs).
- Schedule management is available in **Workshop mode**. If the user asks in Run mode, tell them to switch.

### Two schedule types: cron vs calendar

Every schedule in `workflow.json` has a `schedule_type` — `"cron"` (default) or `"calendar"`. They are stored side by side under the same `schedules` key; the difference is *when* they fire.

- **`cron`** — a repeating pattern that fires forever on a cadence (`create_schedule`, `cron_expression`). Use for "every weekday at 9 AM", "every 30 minutes", "first of the month". This is the default; everything in *Three ways to schedule* and *Writing messages* below applies to cron schedules.
- **`calendar`** — a fixed list of specific dated runs, each firing exactly once (`create_calendar_schedule`, `calendar_items`). Use when the user gives concrete dates/times instead of a recurring rhythm — e.g. a full-month Instagram content calendar, a launch sequence, a one-off batch on three specific days. There is no `cron_expression`; the scheduler registers **one job per future `calendar_item`** and each item fires once at its date+time, then is done.

**Choosing:** if the user describes a *rhythm* ("every…", "daily", "weekly") use cron; if they enumerate *dates* ("on the 3rd, 7th, and 12th", "post these on these days") use calendar. When in doubt, ask whether the runs repeat or are a fixed set of dates.

**`create_calendar_schedule` payload:**

```
{ "name": "March content calendar", "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
  "group_names": ["group-1"], "mode": "workshop", "workshop_mode": "run",
  "calendar_items": [
    { "date": "2026-03-03", "time": "09:00", "description": "Optional note" },
    { "date": "2026-03-07", "time": "18:30" }
  ] }
```

- `calendar_items` (required): each needs `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and `time` (`HH:MM`), both interpreted in the schedule's `timezone`. `description` is an optional per-item note; `messages` is an optional per-item message queue.
- `timezone` (required, IANA — e.g. `Asia/Kolkata`, not `IST`) and `group_names` (required) work exactly as for cron schedules.
- **Mode is the same as cron**: workflow schedules use `mode="workshop"`. Supply per-item `messages` or a top-level default `messages` array when the default full-workflow run instruction is not specific enough.
- Past-dated items are skipped — only future items get registered. To change a calendar schedule, update its `calendar_items` (add/remove dates); editing tools (`update_schedule`, `delete_schedule`, `trigger_schedule`, `get_schedule_runs`) work on calendar schedules too.

> The cron flow for **multi-agent chat** schedules (`multiagent-schedules.json`, edited via shell) is separate and cron-only — see `read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/schedule-management.md"}])`. Calendar schedules are a **workflow-schedule** feature and live in `workflow.json`.

### How workflow schedules execute

Workflow schedules always use the workshop builder execution path. Do not create direct `mode="workflow"` schedules; legacy manifests with that value are normalized to workshop execution.

- **Run** (`mode=workshop`, `workshop_mode=run`) — LLM-driven execution with per-step notifications. `messages` is optional; if omitted, the scheduler sends a default full-workflow run instruction. Prefer an explicit message when you need group-specific wording, backup instructions, or strict unattended behavior.

**Default mode rule:** create workflow schedules with `mode="workshop"`. New schedules should never use `mode="workflow"`.

**`/pulse-setup` rule**: When setting up recurring Pulse, create or update the recurring execution schedule only: `mode="workshop", workshop_mode="run"` with a message that calls `run_full_workflow(group_name="...")` for each configured group, and enable Pulse with `update_workflow_config(post_run_monitor=true)`. Do not create a separate optimizer Goal Advisor schedule; Pulse Gate decides when the Goal Advisor module is due. `/goal-advisor` is a one-off strategy review and must not change schedules or the Pulse toggle.

### Back up scheduled workflows

Scheduled runs execute unattended and accumulate state (`workflow.json`, `planning/`, `knowledgebase/`, `learnings/`, `db/`, reports) that otherwise lives only on local disk. **Whenever you set up a recurring schedule, also arrange a backup** so each run persists its output off-box. Load `read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/backup-strategy.md"}])`, follow it once to initialise the workflow's backup destination, and persist the result in `workflow.json.backup`.

- Set `workflow.json.backup.enabled=true`, `mode="agent"`, `triggers.after_scheduled_run=true`, and a `destinations` entry for each backup target (git/github for config, R2/S3/B2/HuggingFace for large artifacts as needed).
- After each backup attempt, write `backup/status.json` with the destination results, timestamps, summary, and errors. Do not put changing backup status in `workflow.json`.
- If an explicit schedule message is needed, append a final backup turn to `messages`, e.g. `"After the run completes, follow workflow.json.backup and the backup-strategy skill, perform the configured backup, and update backup/status.json. Do not ask for confirmation."`
- If you rely on the default full-workflow message, the auto-notification after `run_full_workflow` will still ask the builder to honor `workflow.json.backup` and write `backup/status.json`.

Confirm with the user before skipping backup on a recurring schedule.

### Writing messages for scheduled runs

`messages` is an ordered queue of strings sent to the workshop LLM one-by-one as user turns. The LLM completes all tool calls triggered by message N before message N+1 is sent.

- Write each message as a plain instruction, like you would type in chat: `"Run the full workflow"`, `"Generate the final report"`.
- **Run mode** (`workshop_mode="run"`): typically one message with exact groups, e.g. `"Do not ask for confirmation. Run the full workflow for group-1 using run_full_workflow(group_name=\"group-1\")."`
- Use multiple messages to break work into sequential phases, e.g. `["Run the workflow", "Generate the final report"]`.
- Read `variables/variables.json` for available group names and include them explicitly in the message if needed.

**CRITICAL — schedules run unattended; messages must never require human input:**

- Explicitly tell the agent to make all decisions autonomously: `"Do not ask for confirmation, proceed automatically"`.
- Provide all required parameters upfront in the message (group names, run folders, step IDs) so the agent never needs to ask.
- Tell the agent to skip or use defaults for anything unclear rather than pausing to ask.
- Never include open-ended questions or `"let me know"` style instructions.
- **Bad**: `"Run the workflow and ask me which steps to optimize"`.
- **Good**: `"Review runs/iteration-0 for group-1, collect read-only reliability evidence, then let the parent fixer choose a bounded repair, an approved plan change, a Goal Advisor proposal, or no action."`

Pulse module cadence is not encoded in schedule JSON. Pulse Gate stores module state in `db/db.sqlite` and decides which modules are due after each normal run.

Do not create new `workshop_mode="optimizer"` schedules. Existing saved legacy
values are handled by migration/backend compatibility; new continuous
improvement uses normal Run mode plus Pulse.

## Shell & Discovery

- **`execute_shell_command`** — Run shell commands. Quick lookups:
  - `jq '[.steps[] | {id, title, type}]' planning/plan.json`
  - `` jq --arg sid "step-id" '.. | objects | select(.id? == $sid) | {id, title, type, description, context_dependencies, context_output}' planning/plan.json ``
  - `cat planning/step_config.json`
  - `ls runs/`
  - `cat variables/variables.json`
- **`human_feedback`** — Open a blocking AgentWorks response card and immediately alert enabled notification channels. Use only for an explicit channel test or urgent, short-lived human-only input such as CAPTCHA, OTP, or immediate approval. In Builder chat, ask ordinary questions in the normal response instead. In bridge-only coding-CLI sessions, invoke its `$MCP_CUSTOM/human_feedback` endpoint with a **foreground curl** and wait for that same call to return the answer. Never use `nohup`, append `&`, delegate/background the call, save its result to a temporary file, poll for completion, or ask the user to send another message after responding. The foreground response resumes the agent automatically; do not set the shell timeout shorter than `human_feedback.timeout_seconds`. Cursor CLI has an approximately 60-second silent MCP-call ceiling, so Cursor agents must use `timeout_seconds <= 45`; after a real expiry, retry only if the input is still required.
- **`create_human_input_request`** — Non-blocking Pulse/goal-advisor/Chief of Staff question. Workflow questions are stored in the workflow's `db/db.sqlite`; Chief of Staff may use `workspace_path="pulse"` for org-wide questions stored in `pulse/db/db.sqlite`. The user answers in the Runloop Pulse/Chief of Staff report panel.
- **`mark_human_input_consumed`** — Mark an answered report question consumed after using it and recording the outcome; add/update the matching historical Pulse HTML card under whoever asked it (Goal Advisor → Improvements, reviewer → Signals, general Pulse → Reflection). Pending questions are rendered directly from SQLite, not duplicated in HTML.

## Skills

Skills are reusable instruction sets injected into step agents at runtime. They live at the **workspace root** `{{"{{"}}.AbsDocsRoot{{"}}"}}/skills/{folder}/SKILL.md` — shared across all workflows. Do NOT create or reference skills inside the workflow folder (e.g. `Workflow/trading/skills/` does not exist).

**Workflow for managing skills**:

1. **Find**: `list_skills` to see installed skills, or `search_skills(query)` to search the public registry.
2. **Install**: `install_skill(source)` (e.g. `owner/repo@skill-name`) or `import_skill(github_url)` — downloads into `{{"{{"}}.AbsDocsRoot{{"}}"}}/skills/{folder}/`. If a skill folder exists but has no `SKILL.md`, reinstall it using the same method it was originally installed with — **never write `SKILL.md` content manually**.
3. **Select for workflow/builder context**: `update_workflow_config(add_skills=["folder-name"])` — makes the skill visible as a selected workflow capability for workshop/builder discovery. **Do NOT edit `workflow.json` manually.**
4. **Enable for runtime steps**: `update_step_config(step_id, enabled_skills=["skill-a"])`. Step execution only receives the skills listed in that step's `enabled_skills`; workflow-selected skills do not cascade into runtime agents.
5. **Remove from workflow**: `update_workflow_config(remove_skills=["folder-name"])`.
6. **Uninstall**: `uninstall_skill(folder_name)` — removes files from workspace entirely.

Use `get_workflow_config` to see the workflow's selected skills. Use `list_skills` to see all installed skills.

## Secrets

Secrets are credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords) injected into step agents as `$SECRET_<NAME>` environment variables at execution time. They exist in three buckets:

- **Workflow secrets** — per-user, encrypted server-side, scoped only to this workflow. Use these by default for workflow-specific credentials.
- **User secrets** — per-user, encrypted server-side, reusable across workflows.
- **Global secrets** — operator-managed via `GLOBAL_SECRET_*` env vars on the server. Read-only from chat.

**Storing a new secret is one step.** `set_workflow_secret(name="BUFFER_API_KEY", value="<plaintext>")` stores, attaches, and injects the value into the active builder shell and future workflow steps. Use `set_user_secret` only when the same credential should be reusable across workflows; it also auto-attaches in a workflow-builder session.

**Attaching an already-stored secret is a separate operation.** Call `list_secrets`, then `update_workflow_config(add_secrets=["BUFFER_API_KEY"])`. The builder can use it immediately as `$SECRET_BUFFER_API_KEY`; no restart or new chat is required. If the requested name does not exist, ask for the value and store it. Never claim that a stored secret is unusable merely because its plaintext cannot be returned—the builder should consume it through the injected environment without displaying it.

Do **not** give boilerplate advice like `"rotate this secret"` after a normal user-requested save. Recommend rotation only when there is a concrete exposure reason: the value was printed into logs/output, committed to a file, sent to the wrong channel, or the user explicitly asks for security remediation.

**Other secret ops**:

- **Inspect**: `list_secrets` returns `global`, `workflow`, and `user` buckets — values are never exposed.
- **Edit a value**: call `set_workflow_secret` or `set_user_secret` again with the same name — it upserts.
- **Delete from store**: `delete_workflow_secret(name)` or `delete_user_secret(name)`. Workflow attachments are separate — also run `update_workflow_config(remove_secrets=["NAME"])` to detach.
- **Detach only (keep value)**: `update_workflow_config(remove_secrets=["NAME"])`.

Secret VALUES are never rendered into prompts, logs, or tool outputs. Builder and step agents consume them only through `$SECRET_<NAME>` in `execute_shell_command`. Never echo, print, or hardcode a secret value in descriptions, learnings, or `main.py`.
