## todo_task — Orchestrator / Sub-Workflow / Pipeline Step

`todo_task` is the multi-task orchestration step type. Users call it
"orchestrator," "sub-workflow," or "pipeline," and the things inside it
"sub-agents." The internal type name is `todo_task`. Load this skill when
designing a new todo_task step, adding/restructuring routes, deciding
between inline `sub_agent_step` and shared `orphan_step_ref`, or
debugging route behavior.

For the broader plan-design framing (when to pick todo_task vs routing
vs message_sequence vs regular), the `plan-design` skill is the authoritative
parent reference. This file explains how to author an already-justified
orchestrator; it does not relax that parent's eligibility rule.

## When to use todo_task

A todo_task step is right only when its parent makes a **real runtime
orchestration decision that the static plan cannot directly express**, such as:

- The set of tasks is dynamic — discovered at runtime — and each must be
  executed
- Runtime evidence conditionally selects or fans out different workers
- The parent coordinates material runtime parallelism or adaptive retries
- An approval boundary or interim synthesis changes subsequent delegation

**A fixed child set and order does not justify `todo_task`.** Different tools,
separate learnings, progress visibility, and easier debugging are supporting
properties after this eligibility gate, not sufficient reasons by themselves.

**Don't use todo_task when:**

- The flow is a single linear conversation — use `message_sequence`
- Several known actions share one objective, context, and output/retry contract — keep them in one large `message_sequence`
- Several known independent fixed actions can be declared as plan steps with dependencies — do that instead of adding an LLM parent
- A list/dataset can be processed in one shared conversation — use a `foreach` item inside `message_sequence`
- The next step depends on a binary or N-way decision — use `routing`
- It's a single focused conversational task with one output — use
  `message_sequence`; use `regular` only for a deterministic script
- The orchestrator description grows into detailed instructions for ONE
  specific task — that task should be its own sub-agent route instead

## Anatomy

A todo_task plan step has two big parts:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "extract-bank-statements",
  "type": "todo_task",
  "description": "...high-level orchestration intent...",
  "todo_task_step": {
    // The orchestrator's own LLM-driven step — picks routes, tracks
    // progress, decides retries. Has its own description, validation,
    // and learnings.
  },
  "predefined_routes": [
    {
      "route_id": "process-each-account",
      "condition": "...when this route fires...",
      // EITHER an inline sub-agent step:
      "sub_agent_step": {
        "id": "process-account-inline",
        "type": "regular",  // or message_sequence, or todo_task (nested, 1 level only)
        "description": "...what this sub-agent does..."
      }
      // OR a reference to a plan-local orphan step (see below):
      // "orphan_step_ref": "shared-account-processor"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Two ways to define a route's worker — pick one per route, not both:**

- **Inline `sub_agent_step`**: a route-specific agent defined inside the
  route. Use when the work is tightly coupled to this orchestrator and
  not reused elsewhere.
- **`orphan_step_ref`** pointing to a plan-local orphan: use when the
  same sub-agent serves multiple orchestrators in this plan. The orphan
  step must declare `shared_with.orchestrator_ids` listing each
  orchestrator allowed to reuse it. The route then sets
  `orphan_step_ref: "<orphan-step-id>"`.

## Route sub-agent step types

A route's `sub_agent_step` can be:

- **`message_sequence`** (the default for agentic route work) — one large
  shared-context specialist span with its own proof, double-check, repair, and
  validation. It can also remember prior turns across the orchestrator's
  invocations of this route.
- **`regular`** — an explicitly scripted deterministic route that needs no same-context
  proof/repair follow-up, or deterministic scripted route work.
- **`todo_task`** (nested) — one nested orchestration layer for a route
  whose work itself decomposes into multiple sub-tasks.

**Nested todo_task limit**: only ONE nested layer is allowed.
top-level → nested-todo_task is valid; nested-todo_task containing
another nested todo_task is rejected. Break deeper hierarchies into
sibling orphan steps or message_sequence specialists.

## Routes vs generic agent vs self-execution

At runtime the orchestrator chooses *how* to do each unit of work — design with
that in mind:

- **Predefined route** — define one only when the work is a **reusable
  specialist that should learn and be validated** (routes carry learning +
  prevalidation + tiering and persist recipes across runs). This is the only
  delegation path that improves over time.
- **Background agent** (`run_in_background`) — the workshop uses it for
  **ad-hoc** work it wants offloaded: isolated context, parallelizable, cheaper
  tier — but **no** learning/prevalidation. Don't create a route for one-off,
  unspecialized work; leave it to the generic agent.
- **Self-execution** — the orchestrator does small/sequential work itself
  (shell/code/db/kb/learnings) with no sub-agent at all.

Rule of thumb: a route earns its place only when its work is a reusable
specialist (and you have ≥2 of them, or genuine coordination). One-off or
unspecialized work needs **no** route — see Anti-patterns.

**Context isolation is a tradeoff, not a free win.** Delegating keeps the
orchestrator's context lean and enables parallelism — but sub-agents (routes and
generic alike) can't see what the orchestrator knows, so it must re-pass all
relevant context in every call. Work that is tightly coupled to accumulated
context is often cheaper to self-execute than to delegate. Don't design a step so
finely sharded that the orchestrator spends more effort re-briefing sub-agents
than the isolation saves.

## Variables and group_name

`run_full_workflow(group_name, ...)` and `execute_step(step_id, group_name, ...)`
both require explicit `group_name` because todo_task orchestrators
typically iterate over the variables in that group. The orchestrator
sees `$VAR_GROUP_NAME` and any per-group variables as env. When you
add a todo_task step, write the description so it explicitly reads
the group's variables / inputs rather than guessing.

## Scripted messages (long, multi-phase tasks)

A todo_task step can carry an optional ordered `messages` list. After the
orchestrator's first turn, each entry is fed into the **same orchestrator
conversation** in order — so it keeps going through the phases with full memory
of its prior turns and every sub-agent result. Use this when one orchestrator
needs to work a long, multi-phase task as a continuous conversation ("do phase
1" → "now phase 2 using what you found" → "now reconcile and write the report").

- Three entry types: `message` (an instruction for one orchestrator turn),
  `prevalidation` (a hard gate between turns — on failure the orchestrator gets
  the failed checks as a corrective turn and retries up to `max_corrections`),
  and `foreach` (data-driven — see below).
- **`foreach`** iterates `db/db.sqlite` table rows and feeds **one orchestrator
  turn per row** (row bound to `.` in a Go template via `message`; `source_sql` =
  a read-only query e.g. `SELECT id, task FROM tasks WHERE status='pending'`,
  optional `max_iterations`). The query runs against `db/db.sqlite` and each
  result row (an object keyed by column) is rendered through the `message`
  template. The loop is deterministic (in code, not the LLM), so the orchestrator
  reliably works through **every** row — delegating to sub-agents per row as
  needed. This is the producer/consumer pattern: one step fills a table, this one
  drains it.
- It all runs in **one execution** — there is **no persistence and no re-entry**.
  For a specialist that resumes across the orchestrator's *own repeated calls*,
  or anything that must "rerun later", use a `message_sequence` **route** instead
  (see the `message-sequence` reference doc) — that is the only place persistence
  lives.
- Retries of the step (on final pre-validation failure) continue the existing
  conversation with feedback; they do **not** replay the scripted messages.

## Anti-patterns

- **Inline sub-tasks in the orchestrator description**: if the
  `todo_task_step.description` contains specific instructions for a
  single sub-task (e.g., "for each account, parse the PDF, extract
  totals, then write to db"), those sub-tasks should be routes with
  their own sub-agent steps. The orchestrator's description should be
  about *coordination*, not *execution*.
- **One-route orchestrators**: a todo_task with only one route and no
  branching is over-engineered. Make it a `regular` step instead — the
  orchestrator shell adds no value.
- **Routing inside todo_task description**: if the orchestrator picks
  between mutually exclusive paths based on a single decision, use a
  `routing` step at that point, not narrative branching in the
  description.
- **Nested orphan_step_ref**: an orphan step can be referenced by
  multiple orchestrators only when its `shared_with.orchestrator_ids`
  explicitly lists each one. Don't assume reuse is automatic.

## Tools

- `add_todo_task_step(step_id, description, todo_task_step, ...)` — add
  a new todo_task to the plan.
- `update_todo_task_step(step_id, ...)` — update orchestrator metadata.
- `add_todo_task_route(step_id, route_id, condition, sub_agent_step | orphan_step_ref)` — add a route.
- `update_todo_task_route(step_id, route_id, ...)` — update a route.
- `delete_todo_task_route(step_id, route_id)` — remove a route.

When inspecting a todo_task step, prefer
`jq '.steps[] | select(.id == "<step-id>") | {type, todo_task_step, predefined_routes}' planning/plan.json`
over `cat planning/plan.json | less`.

## Designing well

1. Write the **orchestrator's description** about coordination —
   discovering tasks, choosing routes, retrying, finishing. Not about
   the work each task does.
2. Identify **2–4 routes** that cover the expected branches. More than
   ~5 routes is a sign the orchestrator is doing too much; consider
   splitting.
3. For each route, decide: inline `sub_agent_step` (specific, not
   reusable) or `orphan_step_ref` (shared, reusable).
4. If a route's work is multi-step + dynamic, consider making it a
   nested `todo_task` — but only one nested layer.
5. **Validation** lives on the orchestrator's `todo_task_step` (whether
   the overall set of tasks completed successfully) and on each
   sub-agent step (whether that task's specific output is valid).
