Design the workflow's reporting UI from the ground up. **Load `read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/report-plan.md"}])` first and follow it** — it is the canonical report model (a report is HTML document(s) in `reports/report_plan.json` reading `db/db.sqlite` live via `window.report`, no widget grammar) plus the content guide, design-quality bar, theming, and responsive rules. Also load `read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/html-output.md"}])` for the layout + dark-mode skeleton to start from. This skill is the *process*; that reference is the *substance*.{{if .Focus}}

STEP 1 — UNDERSTAND WHAT TO SHOW
- Clarify with the user what the report should answer: who reads it, the key questions/KPIs, and whether it's one report or per-entity (per-PAN, per-account, per-route).
- Inspect the data the report will read: `sqlite3 db/db.sqlite ".schema"` and `SELECT ... LIMIT` the relevant tables; check `db/README.md`, `db/assets/`, and `knowledgebase/context/context.md`. If routed, read the route list and decide which tabs the report needs.
- If the tables are empty, run the producing step (`execute_step`) or `run_full_workflow(group_name=..., disable_eval=true)` so you design against real data, not guesses.

STEP 2 — DECIDE THE STRUCTURE
- Everything is HTML; the only structural decision is **single document vs. tabbed per-entity**. For a multi-entity report (per-PAN, per-route), author one HTML document per entity and put them in a **tabbed** section; otherwise a single document.
- Even a plain narrative report is HTML — start from the `html-output` skeleton so it's quick to author and consistent. HTML covers prose + tables AND live charts, so there's no format to choose.

STEP 3 — AUTHOR THE DOCUMENT(S)
- Write the file under `db/reports/` (e.g. `db/reports/report.html`, or `db/reports/<entity>/report.html` per entity). **Author it ONCE and wire it to read data live via `window.report`** — do NOT add a workflow step that regenerates the report each run, and do NOT bake live data into the HTML as static text.
- Hold the design bar from the reference doc: lead with a summary/KPI band; clear hierarchy and generous whitespace; one accent + neutral palette; tables right-align numbers; **WCAG AA contrast in BOTH light and dark**; self-contained (inline all CSS/JS, no CDN); **do not pin body height** (the frame auto-sizes); fluid/responsive down to ~480px; key off the app theme (`.dark` / `data-theme`, the `report:theme` event) or use the injected `hsl(var(--token))` palette so it matches the app and flips with light/dark.
- Show data as tables (right-aligned, tabular-nums), never raw JSON; lead with the answer/TL;DR; use clear headings and **bold** key figures.

STEP 4 — REGISTER, VALIDATE, PREVIEW
- Register each document with `upsert_report_widget` (kind `file`, `renderFormat` `html`, `source` = the file path). For per-entity, `set_section_layout(mode="tabs")` and give each document `tab: "<entity name>"`. Set a palette with `set_report_theme` if wanted.
- Call `validate_report_plan` after every edit; fix and re-validate until clean.
- Call `preview_report_render` to confirm it renders with current data.

STEP 5 — OPTIONAL VISUAL REVIEW
- Only if the user asks to review it visually (or it's clearly part of the task): open `/report?path=<base64url path>` with `agent-browser` at desktop/tablet/mobile widths, **screenshot with `--full`** (full scroll height — a plain screenshot clips below the viewport fold), render BOTH light and dark, `read_image`, and critique against the design bar — hierarchy, spacing, contrast in both themes, alignment, no clipping, chart legibility. Fix the real HTML and repeat until polished. Otherwise validate and stop. (Full instructions in the reference doc.)

Before authoring anything large, show the user your plan: how many documents/tabs and what each shows. Author after they confirm, then validate and preview.
