Design the workflow's reporting UI from the ground up. Load
`read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/reporting-policy.md"},{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/html-output.md"}])`
first and follow it. A workflow report is one complete HTML experience at
`db/reports/index.html`; its own HTML chooses tabs, sections, sidebar, or a
single scrolling layout. There is no `report_plan.json`, JSON layout, report
widget, or platform-generated report navigation.{{if .Focus}}

Focus on: {{.Focus}}.{{end}}

Every report must include one section, as its own top-level tab — not a
subsection scrolled past within another tab, and not merely an anchored
region on a single scrolling page — that answers "what did this workflow
actually do," in plain, non-technical language: recent runs and the
actions taken in each, in the order a non-technical reader would want
them, with no raw JSON, internal IDs, or state codes. Name it for
the workflow's real run cadence: `Daily Action` (or `Today's Actions`) for a
workflow that genuinely runs daily, `Recent Activity` or `Latest Run` for
one that runs hourly, weekly, or on demand. Even a report with no other
distinct views needs this one top-level tab; the rest of the report's
content becomes a second tab rather than the whole page staying tab-less.

**Build it from the run summaries you already send, by default.**
`notify_user(notification_kind="run_summary")` already writes a structured
row (title, status, message, fields, timestamp) into
`org_dashboard_notifications` in the same `db/db.sqlite`, for every run.
Query `notification_kind = 'run_summary'` ordered by `created_at desc` for
this tab — that is the default, and it needs no new step, table, or
column. Its `message` is agent-written markdown: pass it through
`window.report.renderMarkdown` so headings, bullets and inline code read
properly instead of showing raw `###` and backticks. Show "no runs recorded yet" when the table has no rows rather
than treating it as an error. Only design something custom — a bespoke
table, richer per-run detail — when the parent has explicitly asked for a
different or more detailed activity view than the run summaries give
them; never add a step or table whose only purpose is feeding this tab.

For route-specific activity, use the existing row's `route_summaries_json`
array. Each entry has `routing_step_id`, `route_id`, `label`, `title`, `status`,
`message`, and optional `fields`/`sections`. Group/filter by the ID pair and
display the readable label. Major routing choices are sub-workflows; branch
choices remain internal. Show shared work separately, and apply the same
grouping if showing Pulse summaries. Inspect the actual schema before querying
this additive column; absent data falls back to the original message and any
explicit legacy Route field. Missing route scope is unknown, not healthy, and
historical labels must not be guessed into canonical IDs. Preserve timestamps
so a quiet route's old update cannot appear to be today's work.

For report actions that should hand work to the agent, use
`read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/human-in-the-loop.md"}])`
to choose the human interaction pattern, then
`window.report.sendChatMessage(message, { requestId })` from the button handler,
following `reporting-policy.md`. The app lets the user review the message and
reuse or start a chat. Save any existing report-owned approval first; include
the exact item/version and intended route, and distinguish approval saved,
request cancelled, request queued, and evidence of actual completion. Never
send during rendering or polling.

1. Decide the reader's questions and the durable DB/asset evidence that answers
   them. Design one coherent reporting experience; use internal views only for
   genuinely distinct questions.
2. Inspect the real DB schema and sample rows before authoring. Do not invent
   values or make a workflow run regenerate a report.
3. Write the complete experience as `db/reports/index.html`. Include a
   meaningful `<title>` and accessible internal navigation when needed. Use
   `window.report.query` for live data, inline CSS/JS, responsive layout, clear
   empty/error states, no external CDN, no fixed body height, and no nested
   scrolling. Theme off the app, not the OS: style dark mode under
   `:root.dark` / `[data-theme="dark"]` (or use the injected
   `hsl(var(--background))`-style tokens) — `prefers-color-scheme` alone
   ignores the in-app light/dark toggle.
4. **Markdown belongs in the report as rendered prose, never as raw text.**
   A markdown file the workflow keeps under `db/` (a weekly summary, a
   strategy note, a generated brief) drops in with one call, themed to
   match the page; a markdown string from a query row goes through
   `renderMarkdown`:

   ```js
   window.report.ready(async function () {
     document.getElementById('brief').innerHTML =
       await window.report.getHtml('db/notes/weekly-brief.md');
     const rows = await window.report.query("SELECT message FROM org_dashboard_notifications WHERE notification_kind='run_summary' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5");
     document.getElementById('runs').innerHTML =
       rows.map(r => window.report.renderMarkdown(r.message)).join('');
   });
   ```

   Links and images inside that markdown that point at workspace files
   (`db/assets/chart.png`, `db/reports/proof.pdf`, or paths relative to the
   .md file) work: images load, links open the in-report file preview.
   Use `getText` only when you genuinely want the raw source.
5. Call `validate_report_html` after editing; repair every error. It now
   also runs every literal `window.report.query` SQL against the live
   `db/db.sqlite`, checks that every referenced `db/` file exists, rejects
   external stylesheet/script URLs, and warns when dark mode keys only off
   the OS scheme. A query built from variables is reported as unchecked —
   prefer literal SQL so the validator can see it.
6. Call `preview_report` after validation passes. It renders the report in a
   real headless browser through the same runtime the Report tab uses and
   reports whether it settled, its script/fetch errors, its tab labels, any
   `Loading…` text never replaced, and screenshots per theme/width — open
   them with `read_image` and judge layout, contrast, and empty states
   directly, rather than asking the user to check.
7. When deeper visual review is requested beyond what `preview_report`
   already covers, also inspect the Report tab at desktop/tablet/mobile
   widths and both themes; otherwise stop after `preview_report`.

Before writing a large report, briefly state the sections/views you will create
and what each answers, including the required activity/actions section above.
The report should lead with goal progress and key risks, then evidence and
detail—not raw JSON or a generic data dump.

For typed route rows, `summary_text` contains only the shared lead; `message`
remains the complete rendered digest for older reports. Render the lead plus
route entries once, or the complete message as a fallback, never both.
