Run one combined critical plan review and senior workflow-design review. Read `planning/plan.json` (+ `planning/step_config.json`, `variables/variables.json`) and review the plan WITH the user. Find what is broken, weak, risky, stale, or unjustified across the plan and its dependent artifacts, then explain the better design shape and teach the user how to use each building block well.

When a parent Pulse/Goal Advisor prompt explicitly loads this guidance as a read-only checklist, that parent contract overrides the REVIEW LOG write step: return findings to the parent only and do not edit the plan, `builder/improve.html`, or any workspace file. The parent Pulse Fixer remains the only writer.

## PHASE 1 — COMPREHENSIVE CRITICAL REVIEW

Call `review_plan(focus=<the user's focus, when provided>)`. This is the read-only review engine for plan structure, step descriptions, context flow, validation, skills, learnings, saved scripts, knowledgebase notes, `db/db.sqlite` contracts, reports, variables, evaluation coverage, portability, and alignment with `soul/soul.md` objective and success criteria.

The reviewer returns analysis, never HTML: `module=goal_advisor`, `verdict`,
`next_check`, decisions that look sound, and ordered findings. Each finding needs
a stable `finding_id`, `target_key`, severity, plain-language summary, exact
evidence, bounded `recommended_fix`, verification, and
`user_judgment_required` with reason.

Do not load `html-output` or the Pulse skeleton for the reviewer, inspect Pulse
CSS, or ask it to migrate markup or format cards.

`review_plan` returns an `execution_id`. Capture it. Do not babysit it with `sleep`, repeated `list_executions`, or repeated `query_step` calls. You may call `query_step(step_id="review-plan", execution_id="<returned execution_id>")` once for an immediate check. If it is still running, stop and rely on `[AUTO-NOTIFICATION]` to resume. Do not continue to Phase 2 or write the review log until the review completes and you have its findings.

Treat the completed review as evidence, not as the final answer. Group its real findings by severity, preserve decisions it found sound, and use those findings in the design analysis below. Do not repeat the same artifact scan unless you need a specific fact to draw the map or explain a recommendation.

The `review_plan` agent never writes `builder/improve.html`; that is deliberate. When its completion notification arrives, the command is not finished: Phase 2 and the Workshop review-log write below still remain. Do not report the command complete merely because the read-only reviewer completed.

## PHASE 2 — DESIGN SYNTHESIS

Load `get_reference_doc(kind="assumption-audit")` and apply its plan/design lens. Challenge architecture, channels, sources, thresholds, cadence, routes, and step boundaries that were inferred or hardcoded without user approval/current evidence and may cap the goal. Preserve explicit user constraints; surface material uncertainty under Pulse's Assumptions challenged rather than silently designing around it forever.

## The mental model to design against (current)

- **db/db.sqlite is the source of truth.** A step's real output is the rows it writes to the db (via `$DB_PATH`), not a file. Reports and downstream steps read the db.
- **`context_output` is OPTIONAL.** Use it only for a small explicit handoff a *next step* consumes (it gets injected into that step's prompt), or a deliberate file artifact. If the result is in the db, OMIT it — a hand-written receipt file duplicates the db and drifts (the classic `status: null` while the db is perfect).
- **Validate the source of truth.** `validation_schema` can gate **files** (`files` + json_checks) AND/OR the **db** (`db: [{sql, min_rows, max_rows, checks}]`, read-only queries against db/db.sqlite). Prefer a **db check** when the step writes to the db — gate what was actually produced.
- **`context_dependencies`** is the *file* channel (forward-only, injected into the prompt). Use `[]` when the next step just reads the db. It is NOT required for data flow — the db always is.

PART 1 — VISUAL MAP
Draw the plan so the user sees it at a glance. Annotate each step with its **type**, what it **persists** (db tables and/or `context_output`), how it's **gated** (db check / file check / none), and its **stores access** (db / kb / learnings). Routing nodes show their branches and where they converge.

```
step-1 fetch_normalize_emails [regular, scripted] → db: emails        gate: provenance + freshness
step-2 classify_prove_repair  [message_sequence]  → db: intent/proof  gate: no null intents + evidence
step-3 route_by_intent        [routing]           → buyer | seller | spam
```

PART 2 — INTEGRITY CHECKS (structural; severity CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO + one-line fix)
1. **Unpersisted result** — a step does real work but writes neither db rows nor a consumed `context_output`. Its result is lost.
2. **Ungated step** — a step produces durable output but has no `validation_schema` (file OR db check). No automated quality gate.
3. **Stale receipt** — a step writes a `context_output` file that duplicates what it also writes to the db (drift risk). Recommend dropping the file and gating on the db, OR deriving the file from the db.
4. **Broken handoff** — a step lists a `context_dependency` no earlier step produces, OR its description references upstream data that's neither in a declared dependency nor readable from the db.
5. **Routing fall-through** — a routing step's branches don't all converge: a selected branch's terminal step lacks a `next_step_id` to the shared downstream step (or `"end"`), so execution falls into the next sibling branch. CRITICAL.
6. **Routing with judgment** — a routing step has a non-empty description or implies a decision; routing is deterministic and decides nothing. Move the judgment to a prior `message_sequence` step that writes `route_selection.json`.
7. **Orphan reuse not wired** — an orphan step exists but isn't referenced (`orphan_step_ref`) / doesn't declare `shared_with.orchestrator_ids`.
8. **Circular dependency** — A→B→A.

PART 3 — STEP-TYPE FITNESS (how to use each; cite the step it applies to)
For each step, confirm it's the right type, and flag mis-modeling:

- **scripted** (`regular` internally) — a deterministic boundary only: API/SDK calls, CLI commands, data fetching, parsing, normalization, or mechanical db/file writes; batch related calls behind one output/retry contract. Create it with `add_scripted_step`, then author and test `learnings/<step-id>/main.py`. Any conversational or judgment-heavy work uses `message_sequence`, even for one work turn. Persist scripted results to the db; gate with a db check; keep `context_output` only for a real consumer.
- **routing** — a DETERMINISTIC N-way switch: no agent, **no description**, decided upstream (a prior message sequence writes `route_selection.json`, or the caller passes `route_selections`); `default_route_id` is the missing-file fallback. **Every branch must converge** to the shared downstream step via `next_step_id` (or end). "Loop/if in a description" is not routing.
- **message_sequence** — one substantial same-context reasoning job plus focused validation/critique/repair follow-ups, or a re-entrant specialist. Its ordered `items` (user_message / prevalidation / foreach) share one conversation; they are not a checklist of routine sub-actions and should not issue fixed API/CLI calls or parse stable response shapes. Feed it persisted results from upstream scripted fetchers. Reach for a sequence when follow-up turns depend on transient reasoning; as a top-level step the queue runs once, and as a todo_task route it can be re-entered during the same run.
- **todo_task (orchestrator)** — a dynamic agentic loop / delegation over a list the orchestrator can't enumerate at design time. It delegates real work to **sub-agent routes** (regular / message_sequence / one nested todo_task); it does not do the work inline. If you're writing detailed task instructions inside the orchestrator description, that task should be a sub-agent route. One nested orchestrator layer max.
- **orphan** — a reusable plan-local definition or manual utility agent (data checks, env validation, one-off investigations, or a shared sub-agent several orchestrators reuse). Reuse is explicit: `shared_with.orchestrator_ids` + a route's `orphan_step_ref`.

PART 4 — STORES FITNESS (when to use db vs kb vs learnings; cite the step)
Wrong-store usage is the most common silent design error. Check each step's access against what it actually needs:

- **db/db.sqlite — WHAT this run produced.** State, results, rows, plus durable assets under `db/assets/` (with a metadata row). Every step can read+write via `$DB_PATH` (`db_access` defaults read-write; set `read` for pure readers / report-shaping / validation so an accidental write is sandbox-denied). This is the source of truth — results go here, not into files.
- **knowledgebase/ — reusable DOMAIN knowledge across runs.** Business facts, product/catalog info, portal quirks-as-notes, and user-supplied runtime context/preferences/rules (put those in `knowledgebase/context/context.md`). Opt-in per step via `knowledgebase_access` (`read` to consume, `read-write` + `knowledgebase_contribution` to add notes). NOT for run results (db) and NOT for execution mechanics (learnings).
- **learnings/ (SKILL.md) — HOW to run the task.** Reusable execution know-how: browser selectors/timing, auth/login flows, tool/MCP/API quirks, CLI/SDK command patterns, parsing/retry/recovery rules. `learnings_access` defaults `read` (the step sees SKILL.md); set `read-write` + a specific `learning_objective` ONLY for steps with reusable execution HOW worth capturing. Routing, validation, mechanical transforms, aggregation, pure readers, and human gates should stay read-only. Not for results (db) or domain facts (kb).
- **soul.md** — the workflow's long-term purpose/persona (Workshop-maintained). Reference it for "what is this workflow for."

Decision rule to surface to the user: *results/state → db; cross-run business knowledge → kb; cross-run execution mechanics → learnings.* If a step writes results into kb/learnings, or tries to keep "how to log in" in the db, flag it.

PART 5 — GROUPS
Variable groups (e.g. per-account/per-client) run the SAME plan with different variable values. The plan must NOT branch on group identity in prose ("for Saurabh do X, for Anika do Y") — that's either a variable (`$VAR_*`) or, if the flow genuinely differs, a routing step. Flag descriptions that hardcode per-group logic. Check that group-specific values are variables, not literals.

PART 6 — DESIGN LENSES (recommend the better shape, even when nothing is broken)
- **Agentic span / durable-boundary fit** — start with one large `message_sequence` per coherent shared-context span. Modern agents can own a substantial end-to-end outcome in one step, so put proof/provenance requirements, top-level validation, evidence-based double-checking, and repair *inside* that sequence. A step boundary is a **context** boundary: split only when the contexts genuinely must not be shared.

  | Not a reason to split | A real reason to split |
  | --- | --- |
  | a tool call, a source, a screen action | credentials / security separation |
  | a checklist item, a proof check | independent outputs or retries |
  | a routine subtask | clean-room independence |
  | | a human or routing boundary |
  | | context contamination |

  Require the plan to name which right-hand reason applies. Combine adjacent steps that share a context/objective/output and only create pass-through artifacts.
- **Validation sequence, not micro-steps** — 2+ regular steps that reread the same context and need each other's transient reasoning → one `message_sequence`. Split only when the context should not be shared or the boundary buys independently rerunnable validation/retry isolation, clean-room auditability, a downstream artifact, or tool/security separation. Give its first work turn the complete outcome, then add only evidence-based verification/critique/repair turns or genuine intermediate gates; flag one-message-per-routine-action sequences too.
- **Scripted acquisition, agentic processing** — fixed API/SDK calls, CLI commands, deterministic pagination, fetch/parse/normalize logic, and mechanical persistence belong in scripted regular steps. Batch related fetching under one source/auth/retry/output contract, validate freshness/provenance/errors, then feed the durable rows/artifacts into a large message sequence for judgment. Flag plans that repeatedly spend LLM turns on deterministic retrieval or parsing.
- **Gate everything** — every produces-output step needs a `validation_schema`; prefer db checks on the source of truth. A gate catches drift the moment it lands, not three steps downstream.
- **Human gates** — consequential actions (sending messages, spending, medical/legal/irreversible decisions) without a `human_input` step are usually under-gated. Ask whether one belongs.
- **Naming** — "process_data"/"do_step" are generic; "classify_emails_by_buyer_intent" makes the plan self-documenting.
- **Mode** — deterministic API/CLI/SDK/data-fetch/parse/transform steps start **scripted** and should have `main.py` authored and tested in Workshop. Judgment, synthesis, adaptive discovery, and browser/UI work stay **agentic**. The 10+-run evidence bar is only for *freezing* a proven script with `lock_code`, not for declaring an obviously deterministic step scripted.

For each recommendation give: **what's there now** (one quoted sentence), **what to consider** (better shape + concrete example), **why** (which practice it serves).

PART 7 — PRIORITIES
Close with a severity-ordered priority list across both the critical review and design synthesis. Include every evidence-backed finding; distinguish `now`, `next`, and `watch` so the user can act without losing lower-priority evidence. Also include a short "decisions that look sound" list so the user knows what not to churn.

{{if eq .WorkshopMode "run"}}RUN MODE OUTPUT: return the combined review in chat. If the user wants it persisted, tell them to switch to Workshop and rerun `/design-plan`.{{else}}PARENT REVIEW LOG: after the reviewer completes, record every recommendation in one bounded `builder/improve.html` update (read matching plan-review entries first; create the file only if absent — newest on top) using `data-pulse-section="signals"` and `data-module="goal_advisor"`. Include what was reviewed, all `review_plan` findings by severity, decisions that look sound, recommendations grouped by part, explicit priority, and follow-ups. Prioritize findings visually, but never discard findings because they fall outside a top-N cap. Mark as REVIEW (recommend; do NOT apply).{{end}}
