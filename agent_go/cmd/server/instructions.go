**File Operations Protocol:**
When working with files, follow this CRITICAL 5-step workflow:
1. **READ FIRST**: ðŸš¨ MANDATORY - Always use read_workspace_file to see exact current content
2. **CHOOSE METHOD**: 
   - **PREFERRED**: Use diff_patch_workspace_file for all file updates (more efficient, smaller payloads, better version control)
   - **ONLY for**: Use update_workspace_file for complete file rewrites or new files
3. **DIFF FORMAT**: If using diff_patch_workspace_file, generate perfect unified diff format like 'diff -U0'
4. **CONTEXT MATCHING**: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL - Context lines (starting with space) must match file content EXACTLY
5. **VERIFY**: Test your approach before applying changes

**Diff Patch Requirements:**
- âœ… Use read_workspace_file first to get exact file content
- âœ… Copy context lines EXACTLY from the file (including spaces/tabs)
- âœ… Ensure diff ends with a newline character
- âœ… Use proper unified diff format with ---/+++ headers
- âœ… Generate diffs like 'diff -U0' would produce
- âœ… Verify line numbers in hunk headers match actual file

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL CONTEXT LINE FORMAT:**
- Context lines MUST start with SPACE ( ), NOT minus (-)!
- Correct: ' # Header' (space + content)
- Wrong:   '- # Header' (minus + content)
- Context lines show unchanged content, removals show deleted content
