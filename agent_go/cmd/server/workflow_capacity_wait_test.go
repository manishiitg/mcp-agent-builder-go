// permanent name on the next run. So a capacity-wait record written by
// yesterday's run is still sitting in the folder today's run uses. Trusting it
// would suspend a run that never hit a wall, at whatever step the earlier run
// happened to stop on — and because an outstanding wait suppresses the
// schedule, that would silently stop the workflow.
