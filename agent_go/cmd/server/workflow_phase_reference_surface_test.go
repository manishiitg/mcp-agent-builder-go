// Every Pulse step opens with "load builder-reference and follow it exactly".
// That bundle used to be attached inside `if workshopSession != nil`, together
// with workshop TOOL registration. Workshop creation is deliberately skipped
// when the session is already stopped ("aborting workshop creation to prevent
// orphaned executions") — which is exactly the state Pulse's finalizer runs in
// after a coding-agent terminal dies. salesoutreach 2026-08-17: workshop
// creation aborted at 18:26:32, Gate therefore had no procedure, improvised,
// and produced a verdict indistinguishable from a real pass. The only reason it
// was ever noticed is that the model volunteered it.
//
// Tools may legitimately be unavailable. The procedure describing how the agent
// should behave must not disappear with them, so the attach must sit OUTSIDE
// that guard. This asserts the structural property rather than the call's
// presence, because the call was present the whole time — just unreachable.
