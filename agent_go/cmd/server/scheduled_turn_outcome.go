// scheduledTurnFailure returns the error text of a turn that ended without

// A scheduled turn fails in two very different ways and only one of them was
// visible to the scheduler. startSessionInternal returning an error means the
// turn could not be dispatched — that already fails the run. But a turn that
// dispatches fine and then has every LLM attempt fail records the failure as
// events, leaves the session status "completed", and returns no error at all.
//
// hetzner-ssh on 2026-08-18 20:06 is the case: both turns failed with
// "all LLMs failed (primary + 0 fallbacks): claudecode/ [quota_exhausted]",
// the run lasted 8.1 seconds, executed nothing, and was recorded success.
// The comment on the run-folder reconciliation right above this already names
// the same class of bug from 2026-07-29 — this is the LLM-level twin of it.
