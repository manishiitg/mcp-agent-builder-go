// The system prompt is assembled from independent sections, each with its own
// condition. Those conditions used to live in ~14 consecutive inline `if`s in
// handleQuery, every one discarding AddInstructions' error with `_ =`, and no
// two conditions readable against each other.
//
// That produced a real defect: the "CLI Tool Environment" section asserts "Your
// native tools (Bash, Read, Write, etc.) are disabled" and was gated only on
// "is this a CLI provider" — never on the profile — although the profile was in
// scope 118 lines above. Injected into a hybrid profile it contradicted the
// product prompt, and the contradiction won: Codex concluded it had no shell
// and reported the product broken. Diagnosing it meant reconstructing the
// assembled prompt from a coding agent's session transcript, because nothing
// recorded which sections had been applied.
//
// So each section is named, its condition is a field rather than an `if`, and
// the assembler logs what it included and skipped. See
// docs/bugs/hybrid_profile_told_it_has_no_shell.md.
//
// Deliberately NOT modeled here: applying the profile prompt (it calls
// ResetInstructions and fails the turn), and attaching skills or reference
// surfaces (AttachSkill, not instructions). This registry owns instruction
// text; it does not own agent lifecycle.
