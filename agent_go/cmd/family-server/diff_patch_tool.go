// diffPatchWorkspaceFileTool applies a unified diff to an existing workspace
// file. "diff_patch_workspace_file" is already advertised to the model via
// mcpagent's bridgeTools default definition (a fallback description used when
// no app registers a real handler for it) — without registering an actual
// handler here, the model sees the tool, tries to call it, and gets a
// confusing "not registered for this session" error instead of a clean
// fallback.
//
// Reuses AgentWorks' own diff-apply logic directly: handlers.ApplyDiffPatchDirect
// (workspace/handlers/diff_patch.go) is the exact function AgentWorks' real
// /api/documents/*/diff endpoint calls, exported specifically for in-process
// reuse — same malformed-diff repair, fuzzy-match fallback, and JSON re-format
// behavior, no reimplementation and no dependency on a separate service.
