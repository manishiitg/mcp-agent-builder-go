// inbox), or pre-computing the transcription for it to just trust (testing showed the
// model treats an unverifiable claim embedded in a "user" message with the
// same skepticism it would show the child fabricating an answer, and insists
// on checking the real file itself anyway — reasonable caution, but it fights
// a pre-computed answer). Stating the real path lets the model's OWN
// read_image call succeed on the first try — verification stays genuinely the
// model's, only the "which folder" guess is removed. Always clears the
// pointer so the same photo is never re-flagged as new on a later turn.
