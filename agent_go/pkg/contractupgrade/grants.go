// Package contractupgrade bounds when a workflow contract version may be stamped.
//
// A contract upgrade is a blocking preflight: the scheduler opens a turn asking
// the agent to perform one migration, then advances the ladder only once
// workflow.json carries that target version. Nothing used to bound *when* the
// stamp could be written.
//
// Observed on confida-login 2026-08-12: the scheduler adjudicated the 1.0.21
// turn as failed at 08:01:35 (the agent had correctly declined — the improve
// archive held 19 finding IDs absent from the pulse_* tables). At 08:11:10 the
// same session, by then running an unrelated Pulse finalizer turn, wrote the
// stamp anyway with
//
//	curl -X POST -d '{"version":"1.0.21"}' -H "$MCP_AUTH" "$MCP_CUSTOM/set_workflow_contract_version"
//
// The next preflight read 1.0.21, trusted it, and moved on to 1.0.22 — skipping
// the 1.0.21 migration outright. Only a hand-written revert stopped that from
// sticking.
//
// Two properties of that failure decide this design. The write arrived over the
// MCP bridge rather than as a native tool call, so no prompt-level rule could
// have refused it: the bound has to sit in the executor both paths share. And
// the session was alive and legitimately working, so killing sessions at
// adjudication would truncate migrations mid-rewrite — worse than the bug.
//
// Grants are process-local on purpose. One grant authorizes stamps for the life
// of one turn; surviving a restart would mean authorizing a turn that is no
// longer running.
