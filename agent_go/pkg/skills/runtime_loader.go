// LoadAttachable resolves a list of selected skill folder names to
// `*llmtypes.Skill` values suitable for `mcpagent.Agent.AttachSkill(...)`.
//
// For each folder name the loader:
//  1. Reads workspace/skills/<name>/SKILL.md, parsing the YAML
//     frontmatter and body.
//  2. Walks the skill folder and pulls any supporting files
//     (scripts/, references/, assets/ etc.) so adapters that project
//     skills to disk get the full bundle, not just SKILL.md.
//
// Skills that fail to load (missing folder, parse error, network
// failure) are logged and skipped; the loader returns the skills it
// could resolve rather than failing the whole attach. This matches the
// behavior of the old buildSkillPrompt path which silently fell back to
// a one-line stub for unreadable skills.
//
// LoadGlobalSkill returns a small "pointer" skill that directs the
// agent to read the workflow's accumulated learnings bundle at
// learnings/_global/ (SKILL.md + references/ + any scripts/, assets/)
// from the workflow folder, instead of copying the bundle into the
// projected skills directory.
//
// Why a pointer instead of a full bundle copy: the global learnings
// can be large and grows over time, with multiple references/ files.
// Copying the tree into .agents/skills/workflow-learnings/ on every
// session launch duplicates the content and risks drift if the workflow
// updates _global/ mid-session. The pointer skill stays tiny (one
// short SKILL.md), and the agent reads the authoritative files
// from the workflow folder when it needs them.
//
// The skill is named "workflow-learnings" (not the on-disk folder name
// "_global") so listings and description-based matching carry meaning;
// the learnings folder itself keeps the _global name.
//
// Returns nil when the workflow has no _global/SKILL.md yet — no
// point attaching a pointer to a file that doesn't exist.
//
// workflowPath is workspace-relative (e.g. "Workflow/HDFC-Personal-Accounts").

When you need to recall how a step worked in this workflow — selectors, API quirks, timing patterns, conventions established by prior runs — read the authoritative files in the workflow folder:

- %s/learnings/_global/SKILL.md (the main guide)
- %s/learnings/_global/references/ (per-topic detail files, if any)
- %s/learnings/_global/scripts/ and assets/ (if any)

These files are written by step agents during successful runs and shared across the workflow. They live in the workflow folder rather than this skills directory so they remain the single source of truth as the workflow learns more.

If a referenced file does not exist, the workflow has not accumulated that piece of knowledge yet — proceed with general best practices for that area.
