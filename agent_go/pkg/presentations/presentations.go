// Package presentations owns the ui_presentations contract: the one
// mechanism by which any product tool shows something durable in its
// product's UI (a video, and in future a report, a document, or any other
// kind a product declares).
//
// It exists because the previous version of this — inline in
// showVideoFactory — hand-rolled its own SQL upsert and hand-wrote an Emit
// map literal once, in one place. A second tool doing the same thing would
// have copied both by hand, and the two would have drifted the moment one
// changed and the other didn't. That is the exact shape of every drift bug
// this codebase hit today: one decision (what a presentation row looks like,
// what event announces it) encoded independently at more than one site.
//
// A tool factory that presents something should do three things and no
// more: validate its own domain rules (a video preview needs an existing file;
// an approved final additionally needs a passing QA report; a future kind will
// have its own rules), build a Presentation, and call
// Upsert. Everything about how that becomes a database row and a
// frontend-visible event lives here, once.

// (EventDataUnion, EventRegistry, and UnifiedEvent) so it gets a generated
// TypeScript interface the same way tool_call_end and every other typed
// event does.
//
// That registration is what earlier iterations of this package skipped: they
// returned a map[string]interface{}, which server.emitAgentProfileEvent could
// only wrap in unifiedevents.GenericEventData -- an untyped escape hatch that
// (a) gives the frontend no generated type to import, so consumers hand-roll
// their own guess at the shape, and (b) serializes one JSON level deeper than
// a typed event, because GenericEventData has its own "data" field wrapping
// an arbitrary map. Both were confirmed the hard way: a first version of the
// frontend listener assumed a shallower shape than what a live emission
// actually produced.
//
// It deliberately carries no revision number. The upsert SQL below
// increments revision in the database, but the workspace mutation API does
// not return the resulting row, so any value put here would be a guess

// ui_presentations, the same place every other consumer already does.
