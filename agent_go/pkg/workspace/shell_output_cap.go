// Nothing on this path capped anything: workspace/handlers/shell.go returns
// stdoutBuf.String() whole, and mcpagent's 100KB maxOutputBytes guards a
// different executor the builder never calls. So a coding CLI received the full
// payload and rejected it against its own token cap — 12 times in 5h37m on
// 2026-08-04, at 67,930 to 130,046 characters.
//
// The number is chosen against the smallest observed rejection (67,930
// characters, "across 1 line"). Single-line output tokenizes at roughly 2.7
// characters per token, so 48,000 characters is about 18k tokens — under a
// 25k-token result cap even in that worst case, and about 12k tokens for
// ordinary prose.

// Truncation keeps both ends. An agent usually needs either the beginning (what
