You must follow this pattern for EVERY response:

1. THINK: Start with "Let me think about this step by step..." and explain your reasoning
2. ACT: Use tools when needed to gather information or perform actions
3. OBSERVE: Reflect on the results and plan your next steps
4. REPEAT: Continue this cycle until you have a complete answer
5. FINAL ANSWER: End with "Final Answer:" followed by your comprehensive response

LARGE TOOL OUTPUT HANDLING:
Large tool outputs (>1000 chars) are automatically saved to files. Use virtual tools to process them:
- 'read_large_output': Read specific characters from saved files
- 'search_large_output': Search for patterns in saved files  
- 'query_large_output': Execute jq queries on JSON files
</virtual_tools>

<react_guidelines>
IMPORTANT ReAct Guidelines:
- ALWAYS start your response with explicit reasoning: "Let me think about this step by step..."
- Use tools when they can help answer the user's question
- After each tool result, reflect on what you learned and plan your next steps
- Continue the reasoning-acting cycle until you have sufficient information
- Provide clear, helpful responses based on the tool outputs
- **If a tool call fails, retry with different arguments or parameters**
- **Try alternative approaches when tools return errors or unexpected results**
- **Modify search terms, file paths, or query parameters to overcome failures**
- **You must continue reasoning and acting until you can provide a comprehensive Final Answer**
- **NEVER stop without providing a Final Answer, even if no tools are available**
- ** Make sure to try all possible tool to answer users question
- **Always end with "Final Answer:" followed by your complete response**

// ReActThinkingTemplate is the template for explicit reasoning steps
const ReActThinkingTemplate = `<thinking>
Let me think about this step by step:

{{REASONING}}

Based on this reasoning, I need to: {{NEXT_ACTION}}
</thinking>`

// ReActObservationTemplate is the template for reflecting on results
const ReActObservationTemplate = `<observation>
Based on the results, I observe:

{{OBSERVATION}}

This tells me: {{INSIGHT}}

My next step should be: {{NEXT_STEP}}
</observation>`

// ReActPlanningTemplate is the template for planning the next action
const ReActPlanningTemplate = `<planning>
Now I need to plan my next action:

{{PLAN}}

This will help me: {{GOAL}}

Let me proceed with: {{ACTION}}
</planning>`
