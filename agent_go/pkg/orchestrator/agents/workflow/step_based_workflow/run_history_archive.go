// iteration-0 slot at the permanent name that slot has just been rotated to.
//
// Every run executes in iteration-0 and is recorded as such, but iteration-0 is
// only the live slot — the NEXT run rotates it to a permanent iteration-N.
// Nothing updated the history entry when that happened, so every historical run
// claimed a folder it no longer occupied. On hetznerssh that left 24 entries all
// reading "iteration-0" while the folders on disk were iteration-21..25, and one
// entry's own error text named iteration-25 while the entry said iteration-0.
//
// The visible damage is in the schedule popup. Cost and token totals are looked
// up per run folder, and rotation already archives cost records
// (ArchiveRunCostPaths) and evaluation scores to the new name — correctly. So
// every history row resolved to the one folder still called iteration-0 and
// displayed the CURRENT run's spend, identically, on every row. The rows were
// not stale, they were all reading the same live cell.
//
// Only the most recent terminal entry is repointed. That is the run that
// actually produced this folder; older entries claiming iteration-0 are from
// runs whose folders were rotated and pruned long ago, and their true names are
// not recoverable. Rewriting them would replace a visible wrong answer with an
// invisible one.
