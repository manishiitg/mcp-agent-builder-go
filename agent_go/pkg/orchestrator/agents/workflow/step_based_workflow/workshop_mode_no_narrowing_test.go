// Workshop mode no longer decides which tools exist.
//
// It used to: GetToolsForWorkshopMode returned a per-mode name list that
// SetToolPolicy applied every turn. Because that list also filtered
// buildToolIndex and get_api_spec — the catalog a coding CLI caches once at
// launch — a tool it omitted was undiscoverable rather than refused. The agent
// never learned the tool existed, so it shelled out instead of calling it. That
// is how set_user_secret and list_llm_capabilities were each lost for a while,
// and it is unrecoverable in a way a rejected call is not: you can always take a
// tool away from an agent that knows about it, but you can never add one it was
// never told about.
//
// Mode is a focus rule now and lives in the Builder system prompt. These tests
// pin the property that replaced the allow-list: registration is the whole
// story, so anything registered is discoverable.

// Where the Pulse lifecycle tools live is worth stating, because it is what

// the workflow tool pool in cmd/server (createCustomTools with workflowMode
// true), and cmd/server's TestToolSetInvariants asserts their pool membership
// and category.
//
// So under the old design a tool registered by one subsystem was withheld by an
// allow-list maintained in another, in a third file. Nothing connected them,
// which is exactly how they drifted. There is now no mode-keyed filter between
// the pool and the agent, so pool membership is the whole answer.

// Registration takes no mode argument, so there is no seam left where a mode
// could subset the surface. This asserts the absence structurally: the same
// construction path is the only one there is, and it produces a stable set.
