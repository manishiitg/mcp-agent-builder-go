// worked out what it learned; by the learnings turn the KB door has closed and
// the database was never reachable from a reflection turn at all. "Which store

// decided by whichever door happened to be open, and learnings was usually the
// only one. That is how a validator-bug report, a percentile table and a live
// security inventory all ended up inside "skill" files.
