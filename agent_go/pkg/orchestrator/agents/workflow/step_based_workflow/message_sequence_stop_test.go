// TestMessageSequenceHaltsBeforeStartingAnItemOnceCancelled is PLAT-130.
//
// The reported symptom: Stop on a running schedule interrupted the current
// message, the UI and run history both recorded "stopped" — and the next queued
// message_sequence item posted anyway.
//
// The loop already returned on any item error, so the assumption was that a
// cancelled context would surface as an error and halt the queue. That makes
// halting conditional on some layer underneath converting cancellation into an
// error, and session teardown races that conversion: a coding-CLI turn whose
// pane is being killed can return a truncated-but-plausible result instead of
// failing. The queue reads that as success and starts the next item, whose side
// effect is real and outbound.
