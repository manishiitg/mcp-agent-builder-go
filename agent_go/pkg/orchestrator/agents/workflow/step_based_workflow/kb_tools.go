// under knowledgebase/notes/ plus notes/_index.json as a registry. There is no

// in every other case (read-only or disabled) the step is not the writer
// and this block must not appear. When returned, the block covers: topic-ID conventions,
// read-first discipline, append-don't-rewrite rules, _index.json sync requirement,
// and (if provided) the per-step knowledgebase_contribution as a contract.
