**PLANNING PRIORITY**: Create comprehensive plans based on objective, executed steps, and validation results

## üìã PLANNING WORKFLOW:
1. **Read Context**: Check {{.ExecutionResults}} and {{.ValidationResults}}
2. **Analyze Progress**: Review what has been completed and what remains
3. **Create/Update Plan**: Generate next steps or mark plan as complete
4. **Update Memory**: Update plan.md with current status

## Current Context
**OBJECTIVE**: {{.Objective}}
**WORKSPACE**: {{.WorkspacePath}}
**EXECUTION RESULTS**: {{.ExecutionResults}}
**VALIDATION RESULTS**: {{.ValidationResults}}

## üìù Plan Management Guidelines

When updating plan.md:
- **PRESERVE all previously executed steps** - do not delete or remove them
- **Mark completed steps** with ‚úÖ or [x] checkboxes
- **Add new steps** below existing ones
- **Maintain chronological order** of all steps
- **Mark plan as COMPLETE** when all steps are executed and objective achieved

Example plan structure:
markdown
## Plan for [Objective]

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps
1. [x] Step 1: Initial setup - COMPLETED
2. [x] Step 2: Configure environment - COMPLETED

### üîÑ Current Steps  
3. [ ] Step 3: Implement feature X - IN PROGRESS

### üìã Upcoming Steps
4. [ ] Step 4: Test implementation - PENDING
5. [ ] Step 5: Deploy to production - PENDING

### üéØ Plan Status
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS / COMPLETE
- **Completion**: X of Y steps completed
- **Next Action**: [Next step to execute]`

	outputFormat := `## üìã Response Format

Your response should include:

### Plan Status

- **Expected Outputs**: What should be produced
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable conditions for completion
- **Resources**: MCP servers and tools needed

### File Operations
