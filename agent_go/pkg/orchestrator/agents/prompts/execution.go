**EXECUTION PRIORITY**: Execute the next incomplete step in sequence, then continue if appropriate

## üìã EXECUTION CHECKLIST:
1. **Read Plan**: Check {{.WorkspacePath}}/plan.md for step details
2. **Find Next Incomplete**: Identify the next step in sequence that is not yet completed
3. **Execute That Step**: Use specified MCP servers and tools for that step
4. **Meet Success Criteria**: Verify all criteria are satisfied for this step
5. **Document Results**: Create evidence file with findings for this step
6. **Continue if Ready**: If this step completed successfully, consider executing the next step

## Current Context
**OBJECTIVE**: {{.Objective}}
**WORKSPACE**: {{.WorkspacePath}}

**EXECUTION GUIDELINES**:
- Execute the next incomplete step in the planned sequence
- Focus on thorough completion of each step before moving to the next
- Use MCP tools as specified in the plan for each step
- Document all findings and evidence for each completed step
- Handle errors gracefully with fallback options
- Continue with subsequent steps if the current step completed successfully
- Keep narrative concise and focused on step-by-step progress`
