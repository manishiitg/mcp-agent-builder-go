// ExecutionKind names what a unit of work IS, so that every consumer can stop
// inferring it from ID string prefixes, metadata sniffing, or content shape.
//
// Two questions answer almost every presentation decision, and both are
// properties of the kind alone — not of the ID format, not of the transport,
// not of what the content happens to look like:
//
//	OwnsTerminal()     does this have its own LLM conversation a user would watch?
//	FoldsIntoParent()  is this an internal turn of its parent, not a peer of it?
//
//	kind                    OwnsTerminal  FoldsIntoParent  notes
//	full_run                     no             no         container only; not an agent
//	orchestrator                 yes            no         todo_task; dispatches sub-agents
//	sub_agent                    yes            no         delegated LLM agent
//	message_sequence             yes            no         one terminal for the whole step
//	message_sequence_item        no             yes        internal turn of its step
//	scripted_step                yes            no         python main.py — a real output pane
//	router                       no             no         a decision record; emits no pane
//	main_agent                   yes            no         the user's own chat agent
//
// IMPORTANT — Unknown is not "does not own a terminal". Most events in flight
// today declare no kind at all, so consumers must gate on
// `kind != ExecutionKindUnknown && !kind.OwnsTerminal()` and otherwise fall
// through to their existing behavior. Treating an undeclared kind as
// "suppress" would silently delete almost every terminal.
//
// Historically these facts were re-derived independently in the terminal store,
// the rail, and the event dispatcher, each by pattern-matching ID prefixes
// ("msgseq-", "exec-", "workflow-full-"). Every divergence between those copies
// was a bug: message-sequence items fragmenting into empty terminals, "Full run"
// appearing in the rail as if it were an agent, scripted steps synthesizing fake
// conversation panes. Declaring the kind once at creation removes the whole class.
