// WorkspaceLedger returns the open per-workspace cost ledger for

// pool for every later call with the same path. This is the write side of
// PLAT-184: every cost event attributable to one workflow is also recorded
// here, alongside the existing global ledger, so that workflow's own agents
// (Pulse, the Workflow Builder) can read their own cost data through their
// normal folder-guard-scoped access -- the global ledger sits outside every
// workflow's own folder and is not reachable by any agent at all.
//
// Returns (nil, nil) for an empty workspacePath: there is nothing to scope
// a ledger to (e.g. plain chat, or a workflow-builder session before any
// workflow folder has been chosen). Callers must treat a nil ledger as
// "nothing to do here", not an error.
