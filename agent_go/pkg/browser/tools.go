			Description: "Execute browser automation commands using agent-browser CLI. Connectivity check: call command='status' with no args; it needs no tab and snapshot must not be used as a CDP probe because snapshot is page-specific. Call status before first browser use to query the live effective mode and reachable authorized CDP endpoints; CDP availability is never inferred from saved chat state. Supports navigation, interaction, screenshots, video recording, console/errors, network inspection/HAR, and data extraction. In CDP mode, record start creates a fresh temporary context; the backend returns AGENTWORKS_RECORDING_CONTEXT, requires a fresh snapshot, pins actions to the recorded tab, and restores the original tab on stop. It also exposes version-matched documentation through command='skills'. Multiple configured CDP ports are only for specialized multi-login testing inside one workflow. IMPORTANT: Load the core agent-browser skill before first use, then follow the snapshot → interact → re-snapshot workflow.",

						"description": "Command to execute. Call status first; it is a backend-only live check and takes no args. Then call skills with args=['get','core'] in headless mode or with the status-returned --cdp endpoint in CDP mode. Use ['get','core','--full'] only when the overview lacks an exact command, and ['list'] to discover specialized version-matched skills. Browser commands include open, snapshot, click, fill, type, press, screenshot, wait, get, scroll, select, hover, upload, download, eval, console, errors, network (requests/route/HAR), record (start/stop WebM), trace, profiler, back, forward, reload, close. Use reset only to force-kill a genuinely broken browser session and clear all state. In shared CDP mode, do NOT reset for a missing-tab error; use command='tab' to get the selected tab hint, select a known tab, or create a stable labeled tab, then retry open with URL-only args.",

						"description": "Arguments for the command. Do not include the command name inside args. status takes no args. Headless mode has no tab requirement. When live status reports CDP, EVERY later call, including skills documentation calls, must begin with ['--cdp', '<status-authorized-endpoint>']; the backend rechecks and rejects unavailable or unconfigured ports. When multiple profiles are reachable, choose the endpoint for the intended login/account on every call and keep separate labeled tabs per profile. A skills documentation call does not need a tab. For browser actions, command='tab' with no additional args lists real tN ids and URLs. Reuse an owned label or exact URL match; otherwise request a stable tab with ['--cdp','<endpoint>','new','--label','<label>','<url>']. The backend atomically rechecks reuse, returns the real tN and actual URL, and refuses creation when it cannot list tabs safely. All other CDP page actions must include the tab inline; the backend verifies the real tN before every action and switches only when needed, avoiding repeated Chrome foreground activation. CDP record start/restart creates a temporary context: obey AGENTWORKS_RECORDING_CONTEXT, discard old refs, snapshot immediately, and do not switch tabs until stop restores the original. CDP open remains URL-only after the --cdp prefix because it uses that selected tab. Upload sources and explicit download destinations must be workspace-relative authorized paths; the backend stages them across persistent-daemon sandbox boundaries.",
