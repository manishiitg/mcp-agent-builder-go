# Continuity planning

Plan scenes before prompts. A scene is continuous when the viewer expects the
same time, place, subjects, wardrobe, objects, lighting, and causal action to
persist. Script beats inside that scene do not justify separate generation.

## Strategy order

Choose the first supported strategy that fits:

1. **One take:** one request for uninterrupted action within the endpoint's
   duration limit.
2. **Native multi-shot:** one request with the endpoint's structured shot or
   prompt sequence for intentional cuts inside one coherent scene.
3. **Video extension/edit:** use this only when the live route explicitly
   supports a literal extension or edit of the accepted source clip. H3 Max
   Reference-to-Video is not this strategy: it generates a new conditioned
   clip and belongs under reference-driven continuation.
4. **Boundary-frame chain:** choose the accepted clip's last usable stable
   frame at the intended cut point and use it as the next start frame;
   optionally provide a designed end frame. Do not blindly use the literal
   final decoded frame: it may be blurred, mid-action, a blink, or an artifact.
5. **Reference-driven continuation:** reuse the accepted video plus approved
   character/location/object/audio references.
6. **Independent generation:** only for a deliberate discontinuity approved in
   the plan.

Minimize both paid calls and seams. Keep uninterrupted visible dialogue or one
continuous action inside one supported take whenever possible. Do not choose
five short clips for a longer continuous performance merely because each is
cheap or fast. If a real boundary is unavoidable, write an editorial cut on a
completed thought/pause, reaction, insert, or motivated angle change; never
assume a reference-conditioned successor starts on the exact final phoneme or
audio sample of its predecessor.

## State ledger

For every scene, record:

- stable state: characters, face/identity reference, wardrobe, props, location,
  time, weather, palette, lens/camera language, audio environment;
- evolving state: subject position, gaze, gesture, object state, camera
  position, dialogue/narration point, and action at start/end;
- model controls: seed, first/last frame, reference arrays, video reference,
  structured multi-shot prompts, extension source, native/reference audio;
- cut intent: continuous, motivated hard cut, montage, time/location jump, or
  faceless illustrative beat.

Reuse exact approved identity descriptors and reference files. For a real
person, require a user-provided or explicitly approved reference and do not
train or synthesize a reusable biometric identity without consent. A style
reference may guide medium, palette, texture, framing, and energy; it must not
silently import another person's identity, trademarks, or exact composition.

## Prompt rules

- For text-to-video, describe subject, action, environment, camera, lighting,
  timing, and sound with one coherent action path.
- For image-to-video, treat the image as the static contract and prompt the
  motion, camera change, temporal action, and end state. Do not waste the prompt
  redescribing every visible pixel.
- For multi-shot, use the endpoint's exact structured fields and make each
  internal shot advance the same scene. Do not concatenate numbered prose if
  the API expects an array.
- At a chained seam, repeat an overlapping action: end clip A during an action
  and start clip B from the same action and state. Carry forward the outgoing
  camera side, framing height, lens/movement direction, eyeline, lighting,
  object positions, and audio environment. If the next shot deliberately
  changes angle, specify a motivated cut-on-action, reaction, insert, or
  cutaway rather than describing it as uninterrupted movement.
- Use positive visual direction where the endpoint lacks a negative-prompt
  field. Never invent a negative-prompt parameter.

## Explainers and montage

Independent clips are acceptable for intentionally non-continuous faceless
explainers, diagrams, examples, or montages. Keep one approved style key and a
stable rendering descriptor across them, align each clip to measured narration,
and still present every clip for review before assembly. A fixed block duration
is a production choice, not a universal model rule; derive block boundaries
from narration and the live endpoint's duration contract.

## Seam record

For every boundary include:

```json
{
  "from_clip": "clips/scene-01-a.mp4",
  "boundary_frame": "frames/scene-01-a-final.png",
  "to_request": "requests/scene-01-b.json",
  "overlap_action": "the driver continues turning toward the window",
  "expected_transition": "same pose, wardrobe, lighting, location, and camera side",
  "reason_for_new_call": "endpoint duration limit",
  "review_status": "pending_user_review"
}
```
