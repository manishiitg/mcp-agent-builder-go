// The product seeds planning/plan.json directly instead of authoring it through
// the builder's add_*_step tools, so none of the tool-level required-field
// checks ever ran against it. That is how the orchestrator shipped without
// next_step_id: the field is mandatory for todo_task (the tool schema lists it
// as required and validateTodoTaskStepFieldsTyped rejects a step without it),
// but generating raw JSON skipped every one of those gates.
//
// It was not a cosmetic defect. Reading plan.json runs this same validator and
// forgives only a legacy message_sequence "code" item, so the workflow would
// have failed to load rather than run with a missing graph edge.
//
// Running the platform's own exported validator over the generated plan puts
// the product back under the contract every other workflow is held to.
