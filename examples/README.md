# Runloop Examples

Runloop is most useful when it coordinates real workflows, not toy agents. This page collects flagship workflow blueprints that show what teams can build.

## Flagship Workflow Blueprints

### 1. Deep Research Agent

Compare tools, vendors, models, or market segments and produce a sourced report.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Research brief"] --> B["Source collector"]
  B --> C["Evidence reviewer"]
  C --> D["Pricing and benchmark analyst"]
  D --> E["Report writer"]
  E --> F["report.md + sources.md"]
```

Example prompt:

```text
Compare Claude Code, Codex, and Pi for a team building agentic coding workflows.
Include model strengths, tool support, pricing considerations, and operational risks.
```

Expected output:

- `report.md`: executive summary, comparison table, recommendation, risks
- `sources.md`: links, extracted evidence, confidence notes
- Optional scheduled monitor: rerun weekly and diff changes

### 2. AI Software Engineer Workflow

Turn a product change request into a planned, reviewed, and tested code change.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Issue or feature request"] --> B["Planner agent"]
  B --> C["Coder agent"]
  C --> D["Reviewer agent"]
  D --> E["Tester agent"]
  E --> F["Patch + test report"]
```

Example prompt:

```text
Add JWT authentication to the API, update middleware tests, and summarize the security assumptions.
```

Expected output:

- Implementation plan
- Workspace patch or PR-ready diff
- Test output and reviewer notes
- Follow-up risks or manual checks

### 3. E-commerce Operations Agent

Automate the repetitive review loops behind catalog, support, and marketplace operations.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Product catalog or support queue"] --> B["Classifier"]
  B --> C["Policy and knowledge agent"]
  C --> D["Action recommender"]
  D --> E["Human approval"]
  E --> F["Updated catalog, response, or escalation"]
```

Example prompt:

```text
Review this batch of seller catalog updates. Flag low-quality titles, missing attributes, risky claims, and items that need manual approval.
```

Expected output:

- Quality review table
- Recommended edits
- Escalation queue
- Audit trail for reviewers

## Demo GIF Storyboard

A high-impact README GIF should show the product outcome in 15-20 seconds:

1. Open Runloop.
2. Create or open a workflow.
3. Connect tools such as browser, workspace files, and MCP servers.
4. Run the workflow.
5. Show agents completing steps.
6. End on a generated report, patch, or approval-ready result.

Good demo prompts:

- `Compare Claude Code, Codex, and Pi for agentic coding workflows.`
- `Review this PR for security, performance, and test gaps.`
- `Triage these customer support tickets and draft responses.`

The strongest demos show a real output artifact, not only a chat transcript.
