# Prompt Simplification Fix - 2025-01-27

## 🐛 **Issue Description**
The ReAct and Simple agent prompts had become overly complex with excessive tool calling instructions, confusing XML-style tags, and verbose guidelines that were making them difficult for the LLM to understand and process efficiently.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
During the Bedrock tools support fix, excessive complexity was added to both prompts:
- **ReAct Prompt**: Had complex large tool output handling instructions and overly detailed tool calling guidelines
- **Simple Prompt**: Had confusing XML-style tags (`<prompts>`, `<resources>`, `<virtual_tools>`) and verbose tool execution flow details
- **Virtual Tools Section**: Was not clearly connected to the prompt sections, making it confusing for the LLM

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Simplified ReAct Prompt** (`react_prompt.go`)
**Removed:**
- ❌ Complex large tool output handling instructions
- ❌ Excessive tool calling guidelines and restrictions  
- ❌ Redundant "IMPORTANT" sections with repetitive rules
- ❌ Overly detailed tool execution flow instructions

**Kept:**
- ✅ Core ReAct pattern (THINK → ACT → OBSERVE → REPEAT → FINAL ANSWER)
- ✅ Essential ReAct guidelines
- ✅ Basic tool usage guidance
- ✅ Clean, focused structure

### **2. Simplified Simple Agent Prompt** (`prompt.go`)
**Removed:**
- ❌ Confusing XML-style tags (`<prompts>`, `<resources>`, `<virtual_tools>`)
- ❌ Complex large tool output handling instructions
- ❌ Excessive tool execution flow details
- ❌ Redundant guidelines and restrictions
- ❌ Overly specific tool usage examples

**Kept:**
- ✅ Core simple agent guidelines
- ✅ Basic tool usage principles
- ✅ Essential efficiency tips
- ✅ Clean, focused structure

### **3. Added Clear Section Headers**
**Replaced confusing XML tags with clear, readable headers:**
- `## 📚 KNOWLEDGE RESOURCES (PROMPTS)` - For prompts and knowledge resources
- `## 📁 EXTERNAL RESOURCES` - For external data sources and files
- `## 🔧 VIRTUAL TOOLS` - For on-demand access tools

### **4. Clarified Virtual Tools Section**
**Updated `VirtualToolsSectionTemplate` to:**
- Clearly explain that virtual tools access content from "the sections above"
- Directly reference the Knowledge Resources and External Resources sections
- Provide clear guidance on when to use each virtual tool
- Create a logical flow between section previews and detailed content access

## 🎯 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Cleaner Prompts**: Removed complexity that was added during the Bedrock fix
2. **Focused Instructions**: Each prompt now focuses on its core purpose
3. **Better Performance**: Less verbose prompts mean faster LLM processing
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All essential tool calling capabilities remain intact
5. **Clear Structure**: LLM can now easily understand the organization of information
6. **Logical Flow**: Virtual tools are clearly connected to their corresponding sections

## 📁 **Files Modified**

- `agent_go/pkg/mcpagent/prompt/react_prompt.go` - Simplified ReAct prompt
- `agent_go/pkg/mcpagent/prompt/prompt.go` - Simplified Simple agent prompt and clarified virtual tools

## 🧪 **Testing Status**
- ✅ **Build successful** - No compilation errors
- ✅ **Structure verified** - Clear section headers and logical flow
- ✅ **Content simplified** - Removed excessive complexity while maintaining functionality

## 📝 **Summary**
The prompts are now much cleaner, focused, and maintain the clear structure that makes them easy to understand and use. The XML-style tags that were confusing have been replaced with descriptive section headers, and the virtual tools section now clearly explains its relationship to the other sections. This addresses the issue of overly complex prompts while preserving all essential functionality.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Prompts simplified and clarified
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Priority**: Medium - Improves LLM performance and clarity
