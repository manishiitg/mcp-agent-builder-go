# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

This project takes security seriously. We use multiple layers of protection to ensure that sensitive information and secrets are not accidentally committed to the repository.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Automated Secret Scanning
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Every commit is automatically scanned for secrets using gitleaks
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous secret scanning on every push and pull request
- **Daily scans**: Automated daily scans to catch any missed secrets
- **Custom rules**: Tailored detection rules for AWS, OpenAI, GitHub, and other services

### Protected Files
- **Environment files**: All `.env` files are gitignored and excluded from scanning
- **Configuration files**: Sensitive config files are properly excluded
- **Log files**: Log files containing potential secrets are ignored

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### For Security Issues
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** post about it publicly until it's resolved
3. **DO** email us at: `security@yourdomain.com` (replace with your email)
4. **DO** include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible

## üîç Security Scanning Tools

This repository uses the following security tools:

### Gitleaks
- **Purpose**: Secret detection and prevention
- **Configuration**: `.gitleaks.toml`
- **Coverage**: All commits, PRs, and scheduled scans

### GitHub Actions Security
- **Secret scanning**: Automatic detection of secrets in code
- **Dependency scanning**: Vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security issues

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Installation**: `./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`
- **Manual scan**: `./scripts/scan-secrets.sh`

## üìã Security Checklist

Before contributing, please ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] All sensitive data in environment variables
- [ ] `.env` files are gitignored
- [ ] No API keys in example files
- [ ] No passwords in configuration files
- [ ] No database credentials in code

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Use environment variables for all sensitive data:

```bash
# Good ‚úÖ
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="${OPENAI_API_KEY}"

# Bad ‚ùå
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key_here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

### Example Files
Use placeholder values in example files:

```bash
# Good ‚úÖ
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Bad ‚ùå
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=hardcoded_secret_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=hardcoded_api_key_here
```
