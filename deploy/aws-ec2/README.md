# Video Studio — Linux / EC2 Deployment Runbook

This is the isolated public Video Studio deployment. It has one fixed product
contract: the shared AgentWorks platform and the Video Studio surface are
always present; Finance, Dominion, and other product surfaces are not exposed,
and only the `video-studio` backend product is loaded. The release script
validates both allowlists before every deployment.

- URL: `https://video.realtrainingsys.com`
- Region: `us-west-2`
- Stack: `video-studio-prod`
- Deploy method: local build → `rsync` over restricted SSH → user-level systemd restart
- Infrastructure: CloudFormation

The deployer uses the `RTS` AWS profile and an SSH key. SSH ingress is limited
to the deployer's current public IP; it is not publicly open.

## Deploy

From the repository root:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE_NAME=RTS \
AWS_REGION=us-west-2 \
SSH_KEY_PATH=/Users/mipl/.ssh/id_ed25519 \
bash deploy/aws-ec2/deploy-rootless.sh
```

This release path connects as `video-studio`, writes only its own application
directory, and restarts only its user services. It neither runs `sudo` nor
touches infrastructure, the shared login password, or unrelated services.

`deploy-aws-ec2.sh` is retained only as the original bootstrap installer; do
not use it for normal releases.

## Runtime security model

Normal releases run with no `sudo`. A one-time bootstrap/migration uses
administrator access to create the dedicated account and its initial service
files; the running product and every subsequent release use `video-studio`.

| Component | Runtime identity |
| --- | --- |
| Agent API | `video-studio` system user |
| Workspace API | `video-studio` system user |
| Cookie-auth gateway | `video-studio` system user |
| HTTPS proxy | Existing Caddy container, UID/GID `10001` (`video-studio`) |
| Frontend files | Served by the non-root gateway from the release directory |

The release directory and runtime environment are owned by `video-studio` at
`/var/lib/video-studio/video-studio`. The user cannot read the legacy
root-owned environment file under `/opt`.

Do not set `WorkingDirectory` to a release path that the runtime user cannot
traverse. Do not run an installer with `RELEASE_DIR=/opt/video-studio/current`:
that can make the `current` symlink point to itself. Always use a concrete path
under `/opt/video-studio/releases/`.

## Global secrets

Deployment-managed global secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager:

```text
video-studio/global-secrets
```

The secret value is a JSON object with upper-snake-case keys:

```json
{
  "EXAMPLE_API_KEY": "replace-me"
}
```

During deployment, each entry becomes `GLOBAL_SECRET_<NAME>` in the
runtime environment file. The agent makes it available to every Video
Studio project as `SECRET_<NAME>`. Values are never returned by the UI or
`list_secrets`; only names are visible.

`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is the sole reserved entry. It is a Claude Code
setup token used as the deployment-wide provider default, not a project tool
secret. A saved project-specific Claude Code token overrides it.

The deploy script retrieves the Secrets Manager value into a temporary mode
`0600` file, uploads it, installs it, then removes the temporary upload. Never
put actual secret values in this repository, a release directory, or command
output. `deploy/aws-ec2/global-secrets.env` is intentionally gitignored as an
emergency local fallback; use the included `.example` file only as a format
reference.

## MCP configuration

This product has its own intentionally empty MCP config:

```text
/var/lib/video-studio/video-studio/current/configs/mcp_servers_video_studio.json
```

Do not copy the generic developer workstation MCP catalog into this host.
Product tools are provided through the bundled `mcpbridge` binary.

## Agent-to-platform URL

The rootless EC2 agent must call the platform API through its local loopback
address:

```text
MCP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

This is a deployment setting, not a secret. `deploy-rootless.sh` preserves an
existing value or writes this default into
`/var/lib/video-studio/video-studio/.env` before restarting the services.
Do not set it to `http://host.docker.internal:8000`: that hostname is only
appropriate when the agent itself runs in Docker and does not resolve on this
rootless host. A wrong value prevents agent tools such as `show_video` from
calling the Production API.

## Post-deploy checks

Run these checks from a machine with the deploy SSH key. They show service
status and secret names only—never secret values.

```bash
ssh -i /Users/mipl/.ssh/id_ed25519 video-studio@44.253.29.127 \
  'systemctl --user is-active video-studio-agent video-studio-workspace video-studio-gateway'

ssh -i /Users/mipl/.ssh/id_ed25519 video-studio@44.253.29.127 \
  'awk -F= "/^GLOBAL_SECRET_/ {print \$1}" /var/lib/video-studio/video-studio/.env | sort'

ssh -i /Users/mipl/.ssh/id_ed25519 video-studio@44.253.29.127 \
  'grep -q "^MCP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000$" /var/lib/video-studio/video-studio/.env'

curl -fsSI https://video.realtrainingsys.com/

# Caddy does not compress responses by default -- a site block with no
# `encode` directive silently ships the full uncompressed frontend bundle
# (multiple MB) on every page load. Confirmed as the root cause of a real
# "server is slow" report on the sibling Dominion Hetzner deployment
# (dominion-hetzner.md), where the fix was adding `encode zstd gzip` to
# that one site's Caddy block. Verify it here too, against the real JS
# bundle referenced by the authenticated app shell, not just the small
# /login page (small responses compress trivially either way and can look
# fine even when the real bundle isn't compressed):
curl -sS -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -D - -o /dev/null \
  https://video.realtrainingsys.com/assets/index-*.js
# expect: content-encoding: gzip
```

An unauthenticated HTTP `303` redirect to `/login` is expected.

The gateway treats browser pages and API calls differently when the shared
login session expires: pages redirect to `/login`, while `/api` and `/ws`
return `401` with an `X-AgentWorks-Login` header. The shared frontend follows
that explicit signal instead of reporting a healthy backend as unavailable.
Authenticated sessions are renewed when they are within six hours of expiry,
so regular use does not repeatedly prompt for the password; an idle session
still expires after twelve hours.

## Headless browser prerequisite

The bootstrap template, repair script, and every normal rootless deploy install
HyperFrames' pinned Chrome Headless Shell under the unprivileged
`video-studio` account. The server does not need or install desktop Google
Chrome. `agent-browser` remains the browser-control CLI, while both it and
HyperFrames receive the same managed executable path:

```text
AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/var/lib/video-studio/.cache/hyperframes/chrome/<platform-version>/chrome-headless-shell-linux64/agentworks-chrome-headless
HYPERFRAMES_BROWSER_PATH=<same path, injected into guarded commands>
```

The wrapper adds the single-process and shared-memory flags required by the
Landlock filesystem policy. The deployment verifies the managed binary and
`agent-browser` before switching releases, and rewrites the runtime path on
every restart so it survives reboots and upgrades. Do not replace it with
`/usr/bin/google-chrome` or `/usr/bin/chromium`.

The Linux shell sandbox is Landlock-first with a verified mount-namespace
fallback. It grants Chromium only its own `/proc/self` view plus read-only font
and hardware metadata—not all of `/proc`. Do not run the service as root, grant
it `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, or broaden `/proc`, because doing so could expose other
service processes' environments.

**On Ubuntu 23.10+/24.04 hosts, verify the mount-namespace fallback actually
works, not just that Landlock's own preflight passes.** Landlock is purely
additive (no allow-with-carve-out rules) and rejects any Folder Guard policy
that needs one — e.g. write access to a folder except one of its
subfolders — falling through to the mount-namespace path instead. Found live
on the Dominion Hetzner deployment (`dominion-hetzner.md`) 2026-08-28:
Ubuntu 24.04 defaults `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`, which
blocks unprivileged mount-namespace creation for any process without an
explicit AppArmor profile — independent of `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone`,
which can show enabled while this still blocks the fallback. Symptom:
`SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE: Landlock cannot represent this Folder Guard policy and
mount namespaces are unavailable: ...`. Check
`cat /proc/sys/kernel/apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` — if it's `1`,
decide (this is a real security trade-off, not a default to reach for)
between disabling it host-wide (`kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0`
via `/etc/sysctl.d/`, simplest but loosens every process on a shared host)
or a narrower AppArmor profile granting `userns_create` to only this
product's own binaries.

Post-deploy, validate the actual guarded path (not only direct SSH) by running
`npm run check` through `/api/execute` with Folder Guard enabled in a Video
Studio production. A direct SSH browser test is insufficient because it does
not exercise Landlock or the sanitized command environment.

## Future SSM option

The current deployment uses SSH + rsync. If it later moves to SSM, use an S3
or CI-built artifact for file delivery and SSM only for controlled remote
installation. The EC2 instance role—not the deployer user—will need
`AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`.
